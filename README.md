# Ph.D.

I am working at [The Department of Classic Philology and Italian Studies (FICLIT)](http://www.ficlit.unibo.it/it) and at the [Digital Humanities Advanced Research Centre (DHARC)](https://centri.unibo.it/dharc/en), together with [Silvio Peroni](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/silvio.peroni/) as my doctoral advisor. In short the main subject of my Ph.D. study could be summarised as: 
> Using the Semantic Web technologies in SOS (Science Of Science), a study which main objects is understanding, quantifying and predicting the scientific researches and the resulting outcomes, can turn out to be very beneficial. 
> A particular sub-branch of the Humanities, i.e. Digital Humanities, has recently started to work actively on adopting Semantic Publishing technologies. Social Science and Humanities domains are a highly interesting fields to work with for a larger integration of semantic publishing technologies, since few studies have made it in the past.
