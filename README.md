# Ph.D.

I am working at [The Department of Classic Philology and Italian Studies (FICLIT)](http://www.ficlit.unibo.it/it) and at the [Digital Humanities Advanced Research Centre (DHARC)](https://centri.unibo.it/dharc/en), together with [Silvio Peroni](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/silvio.peroni/) as my doctoral advisor. In short my Ph.D. thesis could be summarised in the following abstract: 
>SoS (Science of Science) purpose is to quantify and predict scientific research and its resulting outcomes. The main purpose of my work is the application of this field of study into the Humanities domain, which has gained less attention in the literature compared to the sciences. Bibliometric analysis and social/networking interactions should be taken into consideration. Through this work, I would like to mainly focus on one important macro aspect concerning scholarly publications in the Humanities: Citations. Regarding this, I would like to focus on these two research questions: 
(a) What are the common leading patterns, from a syntactic point of view, used by authors when citing and creating the bibliographic references? e.g. a quantitative analysis of citations in accordance with the sections in which they have been used. Detection, extraction, and classification of references are all thematics covered by this question. 
(b) What are the reasons, i.e. the citation function, to cite other works and what are the most important ones? 
Finally, I would like to turn the information and knowledge gained from the above questions into a practical formation. The idea is to create tools and design models which could highlight meaningful features/metrics, and outlook information on Humanities research from different perspectives.
