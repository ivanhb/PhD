2011,10.2478/v10011-011-0004-8,doi.org,SCIENCE AT THE CROSSROADS: FACT OR FICTION? ,"Modern Academic Science is largely based on the formulation of hypotheses that are then confirmed through observations and experiments. There is little scope for curiosity that played an important role in early Science. Results carrying negative implications are not easy to publish, and hypotheses have a tendency to take on the mantra of religious beliefs. Academic Science is facing on many fronts pressures that hardly existed in the past. Financial rewards apart from salary can be very high, in the form of fees for consultants, expert legal witnesses, patent development, and even the establishment of private companies. Commercial funding forms a significant percentage of the Total Research Budgets in Science and Medicine, but this often leads to loss of control over research protocols and freedom to communicate the results. Media attention confers fame and prestige that is assiduously sought out by some individual scientists, often supported by University resources, and Press Conferences prior to or synchronous with actual publication. Scientists have long been employed full-time by Government Departments, but research contracts are being increasingly offered by the latter to academic staff on a part-time basis. These pressures and opportunities, together with the priority given to research by most University Tenure and Promotion Committees, are tending to diminish the appetite of scientists for other important responsibilities such as teaching and administration. In a few decades, University scientists have moved from the »Ivory Tower« to the High Street, and many are serving more than one master. The above scenario may bring increased remuneration and the pursuit of research that would be too expensive without these external sources, but adverse consequences have also occurred. They may lead to the complicity of scientists, through no fault of their own, in the introduction of drugs and supplements that: a) fail to deliver the benefits claimed; b) increase the risk of some unrelated illness; c) possess dangerous side effects not known or reported at the time of introduction. Examples include hormone replacement therapy and antioxidant vitamins (A and E) to protect against Coronary Heart Disease; dietary fibre to prevent colon cancer; and arguably calcium supplements to treat osteoporosis. On occasions, academic scientists have served as fronts for the publication by the manufacturers of falsified reports minimizing the risk of serious drug side-effects to ensure Regulatory Approval, as occurred with Vioxx in the treatment of arthritis, and Seroquel for schizophrenia and bipolar depression. Individual fraud or misconduct is more frequent than suspected, because most incidents are without major impact and are suppressed by Universities and Funding Agencies. Major scandals are rare, but may have serious repercussions for the general public and bring science into disrepute. Recent examples include: the Cold Fusion controversy (Low Energy Nuclear Reaction); the linkage by Andrew Wakefield of autism with Rubella vaccination; the infamous creation of stem cells by somatic cell nuclear transfer falsely reported by Hwang Woo-Suk. Fraud by commercial companies is subject to the full force of the law, but Science is treated as a self-regulating profession, and as such the punishments handed out are relatively trivial. In essence, Science prior to 1950, except in North America, proceeded along a highway that segre- gated the traffic into Commercial, Government and Aca- demic streams, and passed through inspiring landscapes and green pastures. It later came to a crossroads from which the alternative road led to the Marketplace, and on which segregation into the above three streams was not enforced. It has now become the main thoroughfare for Science world-wide, but there are reasons to believe that this has increased the incidence of dangerous driving and traffic accidents in the form of conflicts of interest, unethical behaviour, misconduct and even fraud. It may be too late to return to the crossroads and continue along the original highway, but there could be considerable merit in restoring the original segregation between the three streams of Science and in developing, as well as enforcing, a stricter code of behaviour, for which some elements are proposed.

“Consequences of These Pressures”;Middle Section","2. The next incident, The Linkage of Autism with Rubella Vaccination, was exclusively of British origin although the regrettable repercussions have been world-wide. A gastroenterologist called Andrew Wakefield took 12 blood samples from children attending his son’s birthday party, paying each of them 5 pounds, and proceeded to write a paper that was published by the Lancet in 1998 claiming that many cases of autism were caused by Mumps/ Measles/Rubella vaccines (42). He spent much of his time subsequently appearing as an expert witness in a series of cases where parents with autistic children sued the manufacturers of the vaccines.;;
Throughout this period, many reputable investigators failed to confirm the linkage in large populations, and other evidence against it accumu- lated. The true nature of Wakefield’s data became known (43). It took the Lancet 12 years to publish a retraction (42), followed by retraction of a second related paper by another journal (44). The British Medical Council barred Wakefield from medical practice (45), but by then he had moved to an Ame- rican University that supported his work.

There are no objective means to diagnose the disorder. Diagnosis is made subjectively, based on the perceived behavior of the subject. This review presents an approach toward development of an objective measure of autism. Covering the literature from 1943 to the present in the PubMed and Ovid Medline databases, this review summarizes evidence of hormones, metabo- lites, amino acids, and other biomarkers present in significantly different quantities in autistic subjects compared to age- and sex-matched controls. These differences can be measured in the gastrointestinal, immunologic, neu- rologic, and toxicologic systems of the body, with some biomarkers showing ubiquitous application. In addition, there are unifying concepts, i.e., increased vulnerability to oxidative stress, immune glutamatergic dysfunction, and pineal gland malfunction. The variances of the biomarkers from the norm present the opportunity to create biomarker arrays that when properly developed and analyzed could result in an objective diagnosis with a rank- ing of the severity of autism for each subject. The contribution of each biomarker to the overall diagnosis could be calculated, thus providing a profile pattern unique to the individual. This profile could consequently provide information for therapeutic interventions on an individual basis.

This distancing between ‘scientific’ and ‘non-scientific’ cultures reflects differences in what are considered valid and reliable approaches to acquiring knowledge and has played a major role in recent science-oriented controversies. Scientists’ reluctance to actively engage in science communication, coupled with journalists’ reliance on the norms of balance, conflict, and human interest in covering scientific issues, have combined to exacerbate public mistrust of science on issues like the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The failure of effective communications between scientists and non-scientists has hindered the progress of both effective science and effective policy.

2011,10.1186/1472-6963-11-60,doi.org,Credible knowledge: A pilot evaluation of a modified GRADE method using parent-implemented interventions for children with autism,"Background
Decision-making in child and youth mental health (CYMH) care requires recommendations that are developed through an efficient and effective method and are based on credible knowledge. Credible knowledge is informed by two sources: scientific evidence, and practice-based evidence, that reflects the ""real world"" experience of service providers. Current approaches to developing these recommendations in relation to CYMH will typically include evidence from one source or the other but do not have an objective method to combine the two. To this end, a modified version of the Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was pilot-tested, a novel method for the CYMH field.
Methods
GRADE has an explicit methodology that relies on input from scientific evidence as well as a panel of experts. The panel established the quality of evidence and derived detailed recommendations regarding the organization and delivery of mental health care for children and youth or their caregivers. In this study a modified GRADE method was used to provide precise recommendations based on a specific CYMH question (i.e. What is the current credible knowledge concerning the effects of parent-implemented, early intervention with their autistic children?).
Results
Overall, it appeared that early, parent-implemented interventions for autism result in positive effects that outweigh any undesirable effects. However, as opposed to overall recommendations, the heterogeneity of the evidence required that recommendations be specific to particular interventions, based on the questions of whether the benefits of a particular intervention outweighs its harms.
Conclusions
This pilot project provided evidence that a modified GRADE method may be an effective and practical approach to making recommendations in CYMH, based on credible knowledge. Key strengths of the process included separating the assessments of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations, transparency in decision-making, and the objectivity of the methods. Most importantly, this method combined the evidence and clinical experience in a more timely, explicit and simple process as compared to previous approaches. The strengths, limitations and modifications of the approach as they pertain to CYMH, are discussed.",“Background”;Related works;;,"Notwithstanding, there has been no evidence to support an association between an MMR vaccine and autism, nor is there a plausible biological mechanism [as reviewed by 29].

We analysed 100 unsolicited letters received by professional epidemiologists studying the causes of autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). The correspondents sourced their ideas from an interaction between personal, social, media, and scientific sources, as well as conducting their own studies. Thus their correspondence represented a form of lay epidemiology in action, and as such provides a useful pointer to how ‘lay expertise’ may be harnessed in practice. The vast majority of the letters put forward theories and hypotheses about hazards related to early twenty-first century society, either medical technologies, unavoidable by-products of technology, or risks created by modern lifestyles. Given the conclusions of previous studies a surprisingly small minority put forward causes related to vaccines. This disparity is discussed. The findings shed light on the nature of public trust of institutions involved in the definition of risk. They underline the strength of public concern not just about vaccines, but more widely about risks of modern society and technology causing childhood disorders.",Introduction,"It is the science, he suggests, often in the form of epidemiology, that defines these risks, rendering them visible.

On the basis of the high-heritability index, geneticists are confident that autism will be the first behavioral disorder for which the genetic basis can be well established. Although it was initially assumed that major genome-wide and candidate gene association studies would lead most directly to common autism genes, progress has been slow. Rather, most discoveries have come from studies of known genetic disorders associated with the behavioral phenotype. New technology, especially array chromosomal genomic hybridization, has both increased the identification of putative autism genes and raised to approximately 25%, the percentage of children for whom an autism-related genetic change can be identified. Incorporating clinical geneticists into the diagnostic and autism research arenas is vital to the field. Interpreting this new technology and deciphering autism's genetic montage require the skill set of the clinical geneticist including knowing how to acquire and interpret family pedigrees, how to analyze complex morphologic, neurologic, and medical phenotypes, sorting out heterogeneity, developing rational genetic models, and designing studies.

This article attempts to clarify some of the ideas behind this concept by examining its operations at the level of individuals and by proposing a conceptual model that includes some elements of social cognition. Indeed, calls for a rapprochement between the theory of social representations and cognitive psychology have been made by Moscovici, in particular, in his 1984 paper on The myth of the lonely paradigm and in his paper on La nouvelle pensée magique (1992) in which he argues that the theory of social representations provides an explanatory framework for the descriptions offered by cognitive psychology and that their combining could translate into a finer understanding of contemporary social phenomena.
Building on the results of an empirical examination of the controversy that surrounded the MMR vaccination programme in the UK between 1998 and 2005, different ways of engaging into cognitive polyphasia are proposed, including what can be described as cognitive “monophasia”, that is, the exclusive use of one type of knowledge, at least at the level of the individual. A brief discussion about the implications of the proposed conceptual model for our understanding of cognitive polyphasia and of the different ways of making sense of the world around us concludes this article.

Parents who choose to selectively vaccinate or avoid vaccination for their children may do so at risk of compromising relations with their family physician or pediatrician. Groups that are associated with reduced rates of pedicatic vaccination, such as parents who access naturopathic care, may be particularly vulnerable to this issue.
Methodology/Principal Findings
In March through September 2010, we administered a 26-item cross-sectional survey to 129 adult patients, all of whom were parents with children ≤16 years of age, presenting for naturopathic care in Ontario, Canada. Ninety-five parents completed the survey (response rate 74%), and only 50.5% (48 of 95) reported that their children had received all recommended vaccines. Most parents (50.5%; 48 of 95) reported feeling pressure to vaccinate from their allopathic physician and, of those who discussed vaccination with their physician, 25.9% (21 of 81) were less comfortable continuing care as a result. Five percent (4 of 81) of respondents were advised by their physician that their children would be refused care if they decided against vaccination. In our adjusted generalized linear model, feeling pressure to vaccinate (odds ratio [OR] = 3.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.14 to 8.26) or endorsing a naturopathic physician as their most trusted source of information regarding vaccination (OR = 3.57; 95% CI = 1.22 to 10.44) were associated with greater odds of having a partially vaccinated or unvaccinated child. The majority (69.6%; 32 of 46) of parent's with partially vaccinated or unvaccinated children reported a willingness to re-consider this decision.
Conclusions/Significance
Use of naturopathic care should be explored among parents in order to identify this high-risk group and engage them in discussion regarding pediatric vaccination to encourage evidence-based, shared decision making. Physicians should ensure that discussions regarding vaccination are respectful, even if parents are determined not to vaccinate their children.",“Discussion”;Final section;;,"Furthermore, although it is true that a number of published studies have implicated vaccines in certain disorders, these have generally not held up under investigative scrutiny.

This article discusses the historical context of vaccine controversies and factors that help explain public acceptance and resistance, illustrating that these challenges go well beyond simple public misunderstandings. The broader vaccine chal- lenges evident along the innovation trajectory, from development to commercialization and implementation include problems in research and development, organizational issues, and legal and regulatory challenges that may collectively contribute to public resistance or confidence.

","Background
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by impairment in social interaction, impairment in communication and lack of flexibility of thought and behavior. Acupuncture, which involves the use of needles or pressure to specific points on the body, is used widely in Traditional Chinese Medicine and increasingly within a western medical paradigm. It has sometimes been used as a treatment aimed at improving ASD symptoms and outcomes, but its clinical effectiveness and safety has not been rigorously reviewed.
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of acupuncture for people with ASD in improving core autistic features, as well as communication, cognition, overall functioning and quality of life, and to establish if it has any adverse effects.
Search methods
We searched the following databases on 30 September 2010: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, 2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to September 2010 Week 2), EMBASE (1980 to 2010 Week 38), PsycINFO, CINAHL, China Journal Full‐text Database, China Master Theses Full‐text Database, China Doctor Dissertation Full‐text Database, China Proceedings of Conference Database, Index to Taiwan Periodical Literature System, metaRegister of Controlled Trials and the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry. We also searched AMED (26 February 2009) and Dissertation Abstracts International (3 March 2009), but these were no longer available to the authors or editorial base at the date of the most recent search. TCMLARS (Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System) was last searched on 3 March 2009.
Selection criteria
We included randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials. We included studies comparing an acupuncture group with at least one control group that used no treatment, placebo or sham acupuncture treatment in people with ASD. We excluded trials that compared different forms of acupuncture or compared acupuncture with another treatment.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted trial data and assessed the risk of bias in the trials. We used relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data.
Main results
We included 10 trials that involved 390 children with ASD. The age range was three to 18 years and the treatment duration ranged from four weeks to nine months. The studies were carried out in Hong Kong, mainland China and Egypt.
Two trials compared needle acupuncture with sham acupuncture and found no difference in the primary outcome of core autistic features (RFRLRS total score: MD 0.09; 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.21, P = 0.16), although results suggested needle acupuncture might be associated with improvement in some aspects of the secondary outcomes of communication and linguistic ability, cognitive function and global functioning.
Six trials compared needle acupuncture plus conventional treatment with conventional treatment alone. The trials used different primary outcome measures and most could not demonstrate effectiveness of acupuncture in improving core autistic features in general, though one trial reported patients in the acupuncture group were more likely to have improvement on the Autism Behavior Checklist (RR 1.53; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.16, P = 0.02) and had slightly better post‐treatment total scores (MD ‐5.53; 95% CI ‐10.76 to ‐0.31, P = 0.04). There was no evidence that acupuncture was effective for the secondary outcome of communication and linguistic ability, though there seemed to be some benefit for the secondary outcomes of cognitive function and global functioning.
Two trials compared acupressure plus conventional treatment with conventional treatment alone and did not report on the primary outcome. Individual study results suggested there may be some benefit from acupressure for certain aspects of the secondary outcomes of communication and linguistic ability, cognitive function and global functioning.
Four trials reported some adverse effects, though there was little quantitative information, and at times both intervention and control groups experienced them. Adverse effects noted included bleeding, crying due to fear or pain, irritability, sleep disturbance and increased hyperactivity. None of the trials reported on quality of life.
There are a number of problems with the evidence base: the trials were few in number and included only children; six of the trials were at high risk of bias; they were heterogeneous in terms of participants and intervention; they were of short duration and follow‐up; they reported inconsistent and imprecise results, and, due to carrying out large numbers of analyses, they were at risk of false positivity.
Authors' conclusions
Current evidence does not support the use of acupuncture for treatment of ASD. There is no conclusive evidence that acupuncture is effective for treatment of ASD in children and no RCTs have been carried out with adults. Further high quality trials of larger size and longer follow‐up are needed.",“Background”;Related works;;,"Environmental factors such as toxic exposures, teratogens, perinatal insults and prenatal infections including rubella and cytomegalovirus, also contribute to a small proportion of cases (Muhle 2004).

The level of access is often reduced by the financial interests of publishers in a market in which there is little sense of a rational order, given huge discrepancies in prices for similar products. At the same time, there are risks to limiting researchers’ access to scholarly resources, both for the quality of the knowledge that is not entirely open to review and for the production of new knowledge that it might inspire.

As studies from several countries found that the inci- 
dence of autism was increasing even after the removal of thimerosal from vaccines, it appears that, in all likelihood, this trend was not caused by the mercury- containing preservative, and potential causes have to be pursued somewhere else. Although many early vac- cines were prepared empirically from live attenuated or inactivated pathogens, recent years have witnessed a shift toward a more rational strategy, in which concepts from disciplines including molecular biology, genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics are increasingly incor- porated into vaccine design, transforming vaccinology into a dynamic and vibrant interdisciplinary field ","“Vaccines & Autism ”;Middle Section;;
“Vaccines & Autism ”;Middle Section;;","One of the most fervent public health debates, the connection between vaccines and autism, was fueled by a study published on 28 February 1998 in the Lancet that proposed a link between mumps-measles- rubella (MMR) vaccination and autism (Wakefield et al., 1998; Poland & Spier, 2010). Several concerns were raised in the years after the study was published, and multiple discrepancies emerged upon inves- tigation.;;
Even though the study indi- cated that the 12 children were “previously normal,” several of them exhibited developmental delay prior to being vaccinated (Deer, 2011). Although the original study described the children as a “consecutive series,” it later emerged that they were highly selected (Wakefield et al., 1998; Deer, 2011). In addition, the study did not include con- trol subjects, relied heavily on parental recollection and beliefs, and was conducted for the purpose of litigation (Payne & Mason, 1998; Deer, 2011; Godlee et al., 2011).

2011,10.2105/ajph.2011.300181,doi.org,Future Infectious Disease Threats to Europe,"We examined how different drivers of infectious disease could interact to threaten control efforts in Europe. We considered projected trends through 2020 for 3 broad groups of drivers: globalization and environmental change, social and demographic change, and health system capacity. Eight plausible infectious disease threats with the potential to be significantly more problematic than they are today were identified through an expert consultation: extensively drug-resistant bacteria, vector-borne diseases, sexually transmitted infections, food-borne infections, a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases, health care–associated infections, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and pandemic influenza. Preemptive measures to be taken by the public health community to counteract these threats were identified.
The 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus is perhaps exemplary of what is to be expected from a 21st-century pathogen. It is zoonotic, with a genome of human, swine, and avian elements whose reassortments may have been facilitated by intensive agricultural practices1; its initial worldwide spread strongly correlated with global air traffic patterns2; its emergence led to moral panic as the World Health Organization declared a pandemic3; public consensus about whether it was safe or necessary to vaccinate was lacking4,5; and its principal medical products, vaccines and antivirals, appear to have been unevenly distributed across the world.
The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic may not have had the catastrophic impact initially feared, but its consequences were nonetheless significant. There were more than 18 000 laboratory-confirmed deaths worldwide,6 and the number of attributable deaths may be several orders of magnitude higher: estimates for the United States alone, provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, range from 8700 to 18 000 deaths. The number of estimated hospitalizations was in the hundreds of thousands and estimated cases in the millions.7 Furthermore, because young people were particularly vulnerable to the virus,8 the disease burden in terms of years of life lost has been substantial.9
The pandemic serves as the latest addition to a long list of recent examples of the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, which currently account for roughly 20% of the global burden of disease.10 Malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis; novel diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome11; resurgent vector-borne diseases such as dengue12 and chikungunya13; and drug-resistant microbes quickly come to mind when considering emerging and reemerging infectious diseases (EIDs), but they are not alone.
A 2005 study suggested that 177 human pathogens have been labeled as emerging or reemerging, of which more than half (58%) are zoonotic agents.14 A separate study reported that 335 new diseases emerged between 1940 and 2004 and that the frequency of emergence has risen significantly over time, with a peak coinciding with HIV in the 1980s.15 The northeastern United States, Western Europe, Japan, and southeastern Australia have been identified as emerging disease “hot spots”; socioeconomic factors (human population density, agriculture, antibiotic drug usage), alongside environmental factors, are hypothesized as key drivers of EIDs in these regions, and this notion has been widely corroborated by the literature.16–19
In a period of rapid global change, it is reasonable to expect that the conditions amenable to the transmission of EIDs will, in some instances, be created or exacerbated. To thoroughly assess how this might affect disease transmission dynamics, it has been advocated that a wider range of methodological approaches be incorporated into epidemiological research and that EIDs and human health be viewed from a broader, social–ecological systems perspective.20–22 This could also help guide public health prioritization activities.
Under the premise that Western Europe is indeed an EID hot spot and that the European Union (EU) is highly connected to other global EID hot spots, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) conducted a foresight project to ascertain how the European Union's social–ecological context might change over the coming decade and what this might mean for infectious disease control in the European Union by 2020. Eight plausible threat scenarios were formulated on the basis of an analysis of how exacerbating (and not mitigating) EID drivers could interact.",“RESULTS”,"Sexual networks will become increasingly global as a result of migration, tourism, and human trafficking.72 Public trust (or lack thereof) in health authorities is another important issue,73 perhaps particularly since the publication of the Wakefield paper (subsequently retracted), which falsely suggested a link between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines and autism.74 Just as low vaccination coverage may prevent herd immunity from developing for many infectious diseases, failure to adhere to full treatment regimes increases the likelihood of drug resistance.",critiques;;,negative;;,yes;;,
2011,10.1080/09687599.2011.618739,Other,Syndrome or difference: a critical review of medical conceptualisations of Asperger’s syndrome ,"We live in a world of vast social differences. People of different ages, cultures, religions, gender and sexual orientation have, and indeed are expected to have, distinct differences in their behaviour, and in the way that they see the world. Asperger’s syndrome (AS) is no different. People with AS have different personal- ity types and have different perceptions of the world. Yet medical conceptualisa- tions of AS have led to it being viewed as a deficit, a ‘pervasive developmental disorder’ that should be diagnosed and treated to allow the person to function in ‘normal’ society. Research has focused on finding neurological and genetic ‘abnormalities’ to explain what is in fact a complex pattern of behaviour, no differ- ent from the behavioural differences between any social group. This paper attempts to provide a critical review of the literature behind medical conceptualisa- tions of AS, and will seek to find a new conceptualisation, drawing on recent criticisms of its medicalisation, to shift the barriers to view AS, not as a medical condition but as a social difference that should be accepted, not reduced. ",“Biological and neurological theories of Asperger’s syndrome”;Middle Section;;,"This is another example of advocates of the medical model attempting to trivialise and reduce human behaviour into a simple condition with a distinct cause and a clear set of symptoms, whilst in reality such explanations fail to account for the complexity of the differences seen in AS and fail to contest the view that AS is in fact a differ- ence, not a mental disorder. 
Another classic example of the medical model’s approach and its tendency to attempt to reduce symptoms into a set of recognisable symptoms, with clear and specific causes, can be seen in the now discredited research of Wakefield (1998). There is evidence to suggest that autism may be caused by viral infections, particu- larly cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus and Candida albicans.

All of these changes have been met with shifts in the public acceptance of the relevant vaccine. These shifts are characterized not only by the number of people willing to be vaccinated, but also by the attitudes and the motives related to acceptance. Examination of the interrelationship between changes in vaccination realities, and changes in acceptance patterns suggests that today, the public has a better understanding of vaccination, is acting in a more reflexive way, and is capable of changing attitudes and behavior. All together, changes in vaccination enhance debates and dialogues about vaccines, and lead to higher awareness and more conscious acceptance.",“The MMR/Autism Scare and the Dynamics of Vaccination Acceptance ”;Middle Section;;,"These controversies affected vaccine acceptance to various degrees, but in the long run did not impair the progress of vaccination.

The recent controversy about the MMR vaccine and its link to autism, with the prestigious journal Lancet (Wakefield, Murch, & Anthony, 1998) retracting a published article 12 years after it had successfully passed peer review (Deer, 2011a), demonstrates blind peer review to be far from foolproof in its ability to provide an imprimatur of scientific legitimacy.

Pharmacoepidemiologic principles can be applied to various aspects of the prelicensure and postlicensure processes for vaccines to enhance our scientific understanding of vaccine safety.

2012,10.1002/pds.3217,doi.org,Vaccine discontinuation and switching following regulatory interventions in response to rotavirus vaccine contamination with porcine circovirus DNA fragments,"Purpose
The Food and Drug Administration temporarily suspended monovalent rotavirus vaccine (RV1) use following discovery of contamination with porcine circovirus fragments and subsequently announced similar contamination of the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5) but recommended continued use of the product. We assessed the utilization of these vaccines in relation to the announcements.
Methods
Using claims submitted to a commercial health insurer for administration of RV1 and RV5, we estimated the number of administrations of the vaccines and the extent of switching between RV1 and RV5. Procedure codes on submitted claims identified vaccine administrations among infants ≤ 1 year old through 16 June 2010. Among infants who received a first dose of vaccine before the corresponding announcement, and whose second dose was anticipated following the announcement, we estimated the number who received no second dose of rotavirus vaccine.
Results
There were 31 178 RV1 initiators and 514 357 RV5 initiators. We observed a 93% reduction in RV1 doses in the month following the recommended suspension of use, coupled with extensive switching to RV5 (90% of subsequent doses) and a reduction in second RV1 doses (from 35.5% incomplete to 40.9%). There was a 15% increase in number of RV5 administrations following announcement of its contamination, with little switching to RV1 but with a possible decrease in completion.
Conclusions
Recommended suspension of RV1 use led to a substantial decrease in use and extensive switching to RV5.

Mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) are serious diseases that can lead to potentially fatal illness, disability and death. However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness.
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects associated with the MMR vaccine in children up to 15 years of age.
Search methods
For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, PubMed (July 2004 to May week 2, 2011) and Embase.com (July 2004 to May 2011).
Selection criteria
We used comparative prospective or retrospective trials assessing the effects of the MMR vaccine compared to placebo, do nothing or a combination of measles, mumps and rubella antigens on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality of the included studies. One review author arbitrated in case of disagreement.
Main results
We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one controlled clinical trial (CCT), 27 cohort studies, 17 case‐control studies, five time‐series trials, one case cross‐over trial, two ecological studies, six self controlled case series studies involving in all about 14,700,000 children and assessing effectiveness and safety of MMR vaccine. Based on the available evidence, one MMR vaccine dose is at least 95% effective in preventing clinical measles and 92% effective in preventing secondary cases among household contacts.
Effectiveness of at least one dose of MMR in preventing clinical mumps in children is estimated to be between 69% and 81% for the vaccine prepared with Jeryl Lynn mumps strain and between 70% and 75% for the vaccine containing the Urabe strain. Vaccination with MMR containing the Urabe strain has demonstrated to be 73% effective in preventing secondary mumps cases. Effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR in preventing laboratory‐confirmed mumps cases in children and adolescents was estimated to be between 64% to 66% for one dose and 83% to 88% for two vaccine doses. We did not identify any studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR in preventing rubella.
The highest risk of association with aseptic meningitis was observed within the third week after immunisation with Urabe‐containing MMR (risk ratio (RR) 14.28; 95% confidence interval (CI) from 7.93 to 25.71) and within the third (RR 22.5; 95% CI 11.8 to 42.9) or fifth (RR 15.6; 95% CI 10.3 to 24.2) weeks after immunisation with the vaccine prepared with the Leningrad‐Zagreb strain. A significant risk of association with febrile seizures and MMR exposure during the two previous weeks (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15) was assessed in one large person‐time cohort study involving 537,171 children aged between three months and five year of age. Increased risk of febrile seizure has also been observed in children aged between 12 to 23 months (relative incidence (RI) 4.09; 95% CI 3.1 to 5.33) and children aged 12 to 35 months (RI 5.68; 95% CI 2.31 to 13.97) within six to 11 days after exposure to MMR vaccine. An increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR immunisation in children aged 12 to 23 months was assessed in one case‐control study (RR 6.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 30.1) and in one small self controlled case series (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 5.38; 95% CI 2.72 to 10.62). Increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR exposure was also assessed in one other case‐control study involving 2311 children and adolescents between one month and 18 years (odds ratio (OR) 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7). Exposure to the MMR vaccine was unlikely to be associated with autism, asthma, leukaemia, hay fever, type 1 diabetes, gait disturbance, Crohn's disease, demyelinating diseases, bacterial or viral infections.

The evidence of adverse events following immunisation with the MMR vaccine cannot be separated from its role in preventing the target diseases.",“Discussion”;Final section;;,"In agreement with results from other studies and reviews a significant association between autism and MMR exposure was not found.

An 8-year court process in the US federal vaccine injury compensation court ended in 2010 with rulings that autism was not an adverse reaction to vaccination. There were two sets of trials: one against the measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccine and one against the mercury-based preservative thimerosal. The MMR story is more widely known because of publicity surrounding the main proponent of an MMR–autism link, British doctor Andrew Wakefield, but the story of thimerosal in court is largely untold. This study examines the credibility battles and boundary work in the two cases, illuminating the sustaining world of alternative science that supported the parents, lawyers, researchers, and expert witnesses against vaccines. After the loss in court, the families and their advocates transformed their scientific arguments into an indictment of procedural injustice in the vaccine court. I argue that the very efforts designed to produce legitimacy in this type of lopsided dispute will be counter-mobilized as evidence of injustice, helping us understand why settling a scientific controversy in court does not necessarily mean changing anyone’s mind.","“The case against thimerosal”;Middle Section;;
“The case against the MMR”;Middle Section;;","The MMR theory has its roots in British doctor Andrew Wakefield’s highly publicized idea that the combined MMR vaccine might cause autism (Wakefield et al., 1998), while anti-mercury activism in the USA gave rise to the second thimerosal-only theory at around the same time (Baker, 2008). Thimerosal had been added to some vaccines since the 1930s as a preservative to thwart the growth of bacteria in multi-dose vials, and it is about half ethyl mercury by weight. ;;

A British medical researcher and gastroenterologist, Dr Andrew Wakefield, is credited with being the first to propose a connection between the MMR vaccine and autism in a now-famous Lancet paper (Wakefield et al., 1998) and in the press conference he gave about it.

METHODS: The study used a school‐based health survey related to children diagnosed with ASD in Tehran to determine the possibility of comorbid conditions. Ninety‐one children and adolescents with ASD between the ages of 6 and 14 years were included in the study, all from five schools of different districts of the city, using stratified random sampling. All of the subjects had received a clinical diagnosis of ASD (autism, Asperger, and pervasive developmental disorder‐not otherwise specified) by a child neurologist or psychiatrist. All of the schools had registered the subjects and were restricted to those with high‐functioning forms of ASD, and none were identified with co‐occurring mental retardation.
FINDINGS: Results indicated that 72.5% had at least one comorbid condition. There was a trend of higher severity in autism symptoms in subjects with comorbidity. Results showed that attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder and epileptic disorders were the leading comorbidity in respective categories.

These challenges suggest that expanded vaccination coverage to younger infants and adolescents, and more immunogenic vaccines, may be needed in some instances.

In response to these charges, the case of RotaShield, a vaccine withdrawn in 1999 following confirmation of a serious adverse event associated with its use, is regularly invoked as evidence of the effectiveness of current vaccine safety activities.
Methods: This article examines the history of RotaShield, with particular attention paid to decision making regarding its use in the United States and internationally. I reviewed and analyzed federal advisory committee meeting transcripts, international conference reports, government and scientific publications, media coverage, and other primary and secondary source materials. I also conducted six semistructured interviews with former senior officials and advisory committee members at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who participated in decisions regarding the vaccine.
Findings: Decision making regarding RotaShield, including the ultimate withdrawal of its recommendation for use, was shaped significantly by government health officials’ concern for preserving public confidence in overall U.S. vaccination efforts amid several unrelated vaccine risk controversies ongoing at that time. This attention to public perception and external pressures occurred in tandem with the evaluation of the quantitative evidence regarding the magnitude and severity of the risk associated with the vaccine. The decisions made in the United States resulted in foreseen but unintended consequences for international use of the vaccine, including in nations where the profile of risks and potential benefits was dramatically different.
Conclusions: As enthusiasm for evidence‐based decision making grows throughout medicine and public health, greater explicit attention should be directed to the processes by which decision makers and their expert advisers evaluate such evidence and translate it into regulation and policy by means of qualitative judgments.

This so-called ‘herd immunity’ is important for individuals who, for health reasons, cannot be immunized or who respond less well to vaccines. For these individuals, it is pivotal that others establish group protection. However, herd immunity can be compromised when people deliberately decide not to be immunized and benefit from the herd’s protection. These agents are often referred to as free riders: their omissions are deemed to be unfair to those who do contribute to the collective’s health. This article addresses the unfairness of such ‘free riding’. An argument by Garett Cullity is examined, which asserts that the unfairness of moral free riding lies neither in one’s intentions, nor in one’s reluctance to embrace a public good. This argument offers a strong basis for justifiably arguing that free riding is unfair. However, it is then argued that other considerations also need to be taken into account before simply holding free riding against non-compliers.",“A more moderate stance”;Middle Section;;,"For example, in 1998, Wakefield suggested that there was a correlation between MMR vaccine and autism.

Parents exempting from one vaccine most commonly exempted the hepatitis series. Most parents communicated their vaccine concerns with their health care provider prior to seeking exemption.

“Discussions and Conclusions”;Final section;;","The possibility of a link between autism and the MMR vaccine has caused controversy among medical and academic communities, as well as the gen- eral public, and it is important to consider this information when examining news coverage of autism. In February 1998, an article suggesting a potential link between autism and the MMR vaccine appeared in the British medical journal, The Lancet (Wakefield et al., 1998). Subsequent research refuted this association (Gerber & Offit, 2009), however, and the article was retracted after the study’s lead author, Andrew Wakefield, went under investigation for unethical and misleading research practices (Godlee, Smith, & Marcovitch, 2011).;;
The third time frame, 2000-2002, begins with Congress passing the Children’s Health Act, which authorized federal funding for autism research for the first time (CDC, n.d.). In the fourth time frame, 2003-2004, several published studies found no evidence of an autism-vaccine link, and there was breaking news that Wakefield et al.’s (1998) original study on autism had been discredited due to lack of evidence and conflicts of interest regarding research funding (O’Connor, 2004). The CAA was introduced in 2005 and passed in 2006, as noted in some news coverage (Associated Press, 2006), and these 2 years make up the fifth and final time frame in this study.;;
Alternatively, there could be reluctance on the part of journalists to rely on nonprofit organiza- tions as sources for an issue such as autism. The spike in nonprofit sources included in news coverage in 1998-1999 coincides with media coverage of the Wakefield et al. (1998) study and controversy surrounding the autism- vaccine link. It could be that nonprofit organizations became more willing to speak with media during this time, while government and science/medical responses may have been lacking as the controversy emerged and was sorted out, as one recent article suggested (Holton et al., 2012).

These included: pandemic influenza vaccination, seasonal influenza vaccination, travel vaccines, Human Papilloma Virus vaccine and childhood vaccinations. Analysis of the responses reveal three major attitude traits: a) acceptance, characterized by the opinion that targets should be vaccinated; b) individualism, characterized by the opinion that vaccination should be left to personal choice; and c) differentiation, characterized by the tendency to express different attitudes when addressing different vaccination programs. Interestingly, direct opposition to vaccination was found to be a minor attitude trait in this survey. Groups within the population could be defined according to their tendency to assume these different attitudes as Acceptors, Judicious-acceptors, Differentiators, Soft-individualists, and Hard-individualists. These groups expressed different standpoints on all five vaccination programs as well as on other health recommendations, such as screening for early detection of cancer. Attitude traits could be also correlated, to a certain extent, with actual compliance with vaccination programs. Interestingly, attitudes to vaccination were not correlated with social profiles related to income or education, although younger individuals exhibited higher degrees of individualism and differentiation. Taken together, all this is in accordance with the current social settings, underlining the individual's tendency for critical evaluation and self-stirring.

This study analyzed 281 newspaper articles about a controversial medical study linking the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination with autism. Given criticism of the study and its potential negative impact on vaccination rates across multiple countries, the current study examined actors to whom news media attributed blame for the MMR–vaccine association, sources used to support those attributions, and what solutions (e.g., mobilizing information), if any, were offered.

“Discussion”;Middle section;;","While a few studies have examined news media framing of autism (Boyce, 2006; Clarke, 2008; Weberling, 2010a) and the MMR vaccination (Leask & Chapman, 2002), the current study is the first to explore the evolution of media attribution of blame for the MMR–autism controversy over its lifetime—a broad span of time that has included several contentious revelations. Indeed, multiple actors were involved in the publication and dissemination of the Wakefield et al. (1998) study, including Andrew Wakefield and his research partners, The Lancet, the news media, and other conduits of information. All could arguably bear some blame for the direct or indirect promotion of the findings and subsequent impacts.;;
The Wakefield et al. (1998) study described 12 children with enterocolitis—inflammation of the colon or intestines—and developmental disorders. Nine of the children were diagnosed with autism, a pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) typically diagnosed in children between 18 and 36 months (American Psychiatric Association, 2000; Caronna, Milunsky, & Tager-Flusberg, 2008).;;
While scientific experts accounted for one-third of all sources, the majority were nonmedical experts, including parents and politicians.
However, neither Clarke (2008) nor Boyce (2006) focused on news media framing of responsibility or blame regarding the Wakefield et al. (1998) study. Only one study on attribution in a vaccine context had been conducted as of September 2011, and it focused on vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and pertussis. ;;
This study used content analysis of global media coverage of the MMR–autism controversy over a 13-year time span (1998 to 2011). The first newspaper article to discuss the Wakefield et al. (1998) findings appeared on February 27, 1998 (“Child jabs feared to trigger autism,” 1998). This date served as the starting point for a content search. ;;
The coverage peaked in 2001–2002, a time frame that included more than one-third (35.6%) of the overall sample. The time period between the publication of the Wakefield et al. (1998) article and the initial allegations of unethical conduct received the most coverage (Wave 1, 55.5%), followed by the time frame between those allegations and Wakefield's conviction of ethical violations (Wave 2, 37.4%) and the period since (Wave 3, 7.1%).;;
Over the course of the MMR-link controversy, the news media placed an increasing amount of blame on one individual—Wakefield. This finding suggests the news media used certain cues, such as the allegations of unethical conduct and the full retraction of the Wakefield et al. (1998) study, to formulate blame. Certainly journalists cannot be faulted for increasing their blame in light of increasing evidence against the study and its findings. Indeed, the 2011 article in the British Medical Journal that labeled the Wakefield study a fraud directly accused Wakefield of causing unwarranted fear about MMR vaccination (Deer, 2011a).","discusses;;

2012,10.1002/bsl.2030,doi.org,When do we Believe Experts? The Power of the Unorthodox View,"This paper examines the extent to which orthodoxy (degree of typicality) and congruence (degree of similarity with own opinion) mediate the influence of expert advice on decision makers' judgments. Overall, 227 members of the public and 60 police officers completed an online questionnaire involving an investigation into a child sex offence. Participants were asked to first (i) formulate their own “profile” of a likely offender then (ii) estimate the guilt of two presented suspect descriptions (orthodox vs. unorthodox), and, following the presentation of an “expert's” profile that matched either the orthodox or the unorthodox suspect, (iii) re‐evaluate their guilt judgments of the two suspects based on this new advice. Finally, (iv) the perceived similarity (congruence) between the participants' own and the expert profile was assessed. Results revealed two key findings. First, expert profiles that matched a suspect's description elevated perceptions of guilt in that suspect, whilst also, simultaneously, very significantly decreasing the perception of guilt of the alternative suspect. This suggests a powerful rejection and downward revision of the other suspect. Second, perceived similarity of the profile (to one's own profile) was only a significant factor in increasing guilt judgments when assigning guilt to the unorthodox (as opposed to orthodox) suspect. Comparisons of lay judgments with those of police officers revealed few significant differences in effects. The finding that advice is most influential when unorthodox and incongruent suggests that decision makers are more likely to reevaluate judgments when expert advice contributes novel information that contradicts their beliefs. The practical implications of these findings are discussed for profilers, police, and decision research in general.

Parental concerns persist that immunization increases the risk of autism spectrum disorder, resulting in the potential for reduced uptake by parents of younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (“younger sibs”).
Objective:
To compare immunization uptake by parents for their younger child relative to their older child with autism spectrum disorder (“proband”) and controls.
Design:
Immunization status was obtained for 98 “younger sibs,” 98 “probands,” and 65 controls.
Results:
A significant group difference emerged for overall immunization status (Fisher’s exact test = 62.70, p < .001). One or more immunizations in 59/98 younger sibs were delayed (47/98; 48%) or declined (12/98; 12.2%); immunizations were delayed in 16/98 probands (16.3%) and declined in only one. All controls were fully immunized, with only 6 (9.2%) delayed. Within the “younger sibs” group, 25/98 received an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis; 7 of whom (28%) were fully immunized. The rates of autism spectrum disorder diagnosis did not differ between immunized and nonimmunized younger sib groups, although small sample size limits interpretability of this result.

Parents who already have one child with autism spectrum disorder may delay or decline immunization for their younger children, potentially placing them at increased risk of preventable infectious diseases.",Introduction,"Recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2012) reports have docu- mented a prevalence rate of 1 in 88 children in the United States.

A critical analysis of the tenacious search for autism's essence,"Currently, autism is a widespread and diverse neurodevelopmental disorder that includes both severely impaired and institutionalized patients and the fairly geeky but brilliant university professor. Despite its heterogeneity, autism is often presented as a distinct nosological entity with a unifying autism essence. In this article, I will argue that the common belief about the ontological status of autism is that autism constitutes a natural kind. There are, however, two major problems with a natural kind approach in autism research. First, how can we continue to speak about autism as a distinct disease while the condition is marked by such sheer diversity of symptoms, traits, biological markers and cognitive profiles? And second, recent historical works on autism illustrate that there is something fundamentally social and historical about how autism is defined, diagnosed and treated. I will argue that the dominant natural kind approach in autism research is misguided, as autism can only be understood in relation to ideas about what kind of behavior is deviant and in need of correction or support. Furthermore, locating and maintaining autism within the biological realm of the individual obscures an array of social, cultural and psychological issues in understanding the contemporary phenomenon we call autism.",“A Natural Entity”;Middle Section;;,"See for the controversial but extremely influential MMR vaccine hypothesis in the retracted article by

The history of ethical guidelines addresses protection of human rights in the face of violations. Examples of such violations in research involving people with intellectual disabilities (ID) abound. We explore this history in an effort to understand the apparently stringent criteria for the inclusion of people with ID in research, and differences between medical and other research within a single jurisdiction.
Method
The history of the Helsinki Declaration and informed consent within medical research, and high‐profile examples of ethical misconduct involving people with ID and other groups are reviewed. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is then examined for its research implications. This background is used to examine a current anomaly within an Australian context for the inclusion of people with ID without decisional capacity in medical versus other types of research.
Results
Ethical guidelines have often failed to protect the human rights of people with ID and other vulnerable groups. Contrasting requirements within an Australian jurisdiction for medical and other research would seem to have originated in early deference to medical authority for making decisions on behalf of patients.
Conclusions
Stringent ethical requirements are likely to continue to challenge researchers in ID. A human rights perspective provides a framework for engaging both researchers and vulnerable participant groups.","“Apparent ineffectiveness of ethical guidelines”;Middle Section;;

The field responded with suggestions of how fraud could be prevented. However, the Stapel fraud is only one among many cases. Before basing recommendations on one case, it would be informative to study other cases to assess how these frauds were discovered. The authors analyze a convenience sample of fraud cases to see whether (social) psychology is more susceptible to fraud than other disciplines. They also evaluate whether the peer review process and replications work well in practice to detect fraud. There is no evidence that psychology is more vulnerable to fraud than the biomedical sciences, and most frauds are detected through information from whistleblowers with inside information. On the basis of this analysis, the authors suggest a number of strategies that might reduce the risk of scientific fraud.","“Notorious Cases of Research Fraud:

Examples of recent and emergent local medicines and vaccine controversies in several countries are given along with evidence and analysis of how they were managed. These demonstrate, among other things, the extent to which ethnic, religious and cultural issues influence popular perception, and the power of rumour and anecdote in shaping public opinion and official responses to events.
Where safety monitoring systems exist, they are in their infancy, with limited capacity for data collection, credible scientific review, effective public communication and robust crisis management. Although increasing democratic freedoms, including less restricted media, and evolving health systems are addressing the challenges and give hope for further progress, there are still deep and intractable issues that inhibit transparent and effective risk communication and stand in the way of African populations comprehending medicines and their risks in safer and more balanced ways.
Some proposals for future change and action are offered, including the pursuit of a deeper understanding of local and national values, assumptions and beliefs that drive risk perception; tailoring public health planning and communications to specifically-targeted regions and populations; strengthening of safety surveillance and data-collection systems; giving higher priority to medicines safety issues in healthcare training and public education.","“Information, Culture and Trust ”;Middle Section;;","MMR scares and consequences: It was, of course, a fraudulent scientific paper in a dis- tinguished medical journal[10] that sparked the perception of the triple vaccination as a serious risk to children.

In 2009, 40,000 authors of research papers from across the globe were invited to complete an online survey. Researchers were asked to rate a number of general statements about peer review, and then a subset of respondents, who had themselves peer reviewed, rated a series of statements concerning their experience of peer review. The study found that the peer review process is highly regarded by the vast majority of researchers and considered by most to be essential to the communication of scholarly research. Nine out of 10 authors believe that peer review improved the last paper they published. Double‐blind peer review is considered the most effective form of peer review. Nearly three quarters of researchers think that technological advances are making peer review more effective. Most researchers believe that although peer review should identify fraud, it is very difficult for it to do so. Reviewers are committed to conducting peer review in the future and believe that simple practical steps, such as training new reviewers would further improve peer review.",Introduction,"Such incidences include Jan Hendrik Schon, tipped to be a Nobel Prize winner, who published a series of fraudulent papers that were withdrawn from Nature, Science, Physical Review, and Applied Physics Letters (Lerner, 2003).

Retraction is a self‐correction mechanism of the scientific community to maintain and safeguard the integrity of scientific literature. However, a retracted article may pose a profound and long‐lasting threat to the credibility of the literature. New articles may unknowingly build their work on false claims made in retracted articles. Such dependencies on retracted articles may become implicit and indirect. Consequently, it becomes increasingly important to detect implicit and indirect threats. In this article, our aim is to raise the awareness of the potential threats of retracted articles even after their retraction and demonstrate a visual analytic study of retracted articles with reference to the rest of the literature and how their citations are influenced by their retraction. The context of highly cited retracted articles is visualized in terms of a co‐citation network as well as the distribution of articles that have high‐order citation dependencies on retracted articles. Survival analyses of time to retraction and postretraction citation are included. Sentences that explicitly cite retracted articles are extracted from full‐text articles.

Training in evidence‐based medicine is most commonly offered to physicians, medical students and health‐care decision‐makers.
Setting and participants
We partnered with community organizations to recruit participants and develop trainings for consumers, non‐physician health‐care providers and journalists in California.
Intervention
We conducted half‐day and one‐day workshops in critical appraisal of health evidence. Workshops consisted of didactic presentations, small‐group practice sessions and class discussions.
Outcome measures
We measured knowledge and confidence immediately before and after the workshops and at follow‐up 6 months later. We also asked participants to describe their use of health evidence before the workshops and at follow‐up.
Results
At baseline, 41% of the consumers, 45% of the providers and 57% of the journalists correctly answered questions about health evidence. Scores increased by about 20% (P < 0.05) in all groups at the end of the workshops and remained significantly over baseline at follow‐up. At baseline, 26% of the participants were confident in their understanding of critical appraisal concepts, significantly increasing to 54% after the workshops and sustained (53%) at follow‐up. During discussions, participants’ comments often focused on funding and the potential effects of financial conflicts of interest on study findings. Participants did not use evidence more frequently at follow‐up but said that they applied workshop skills in evaluating research, communicating with others and making decisions about health care.
Conclusion
It is possible to successfully conduct critical appraisal workshops to aid health‐related decision making for groups who have previously not had access to this kind of training.","Introduction;;

Thanks to a vaccine, smallpox has been eradi- cated, polio has nearly disappeared, Haemophilus influenzae B, measles and more recently meningitis A are controlled in many countries.

The field of vaccinology has undergone major changes thanks to philanthropists such as Bill and Melinda Gates, initiatives like the Decade of Vaccines and public private partnerships. Current researches on vaccines have more challenging targets like the dengue viruses, malaria, human immunodeficiency virus, the respiratory syncytial virus and nosocomial diseases. Exciting research is taking place on new adjuvants, nanoparticles, virus like particles and new route of administration.

","Rubella, an insignificant viral disease of childhood, can have devastating effects on the fetus if infection is acquired during pregnancy. An immunisation programme was established in the UK in the 1970s, with the monitoring of pregnant women for rubella susceptibility and post- partum immunisation for those found to be susceptible. This policy has recently been reviewed by the National Screening Committee. 
This study examined records of 115 rubella-susceptible pregnant women (defined as rubella IgG titre < 10IU/ml) identified in a South Wales Health Board area in 2010. Of these, 101/115 (88%) were offered post-partum immunisation and 77/101 (76%) of those accepted the offer. In total, 38/115 (33%) left maternity services care without receiving post-partum immunisation.

Qualification users, such as students, parents and teachers, arguably need to have an understanding of some basic principles of educational assessment in order to make informed judgements about the reliability of assessment outcomes, and to develop realistic expectations of what assessment systems can deliver. The goal of achieving this has gathered pace recently with the completion of a two-year research programme in England that explored concerns around technical aspects of assessment and current levels of public understanding of assessment. One of the recommendations of the programme was that qualification awarding bodies should collect and make available information relating to the reliability of outcomes for various types of qualification. Further consideration is required, however, to determine what, and how much, assessment information would be useful to qualification users, and how it might best be presented and disseminated. As a contribution to this process, this paper discusses the communication strategies employed in other fields for the purpose of sharing important messages with the public. Three recommendations are offered for overcoming some of the challenges inherent in improving communication and understanding of assessment. The paper concludes that enhancing qualification users’ understanding of assessment may be achieved by focusing on the presentation of applied, interpretive information and dissemination through influential peers from various stakeholder groups.","“Recommendation 2: Use applied and interpretive information, not description and explanation”;Middle Section;;","In 1998 a research paper described the onset of regressive autism in eight children following receipt of the MMR vaccine (Wakefield et al., 1998; cited in Offit & Coffin, 2003).

A gastrointestinal disorder specific to ASD, the ‘autistic enterocolitis’ proposed by Wakefield et al.

Some studies report a positive association between GI symptoms and greater severity of ASD symptoms (Adams et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2011), increased social impairment and lack of expressive language (Gorrindo et al. 2012) and greater severity of other behaviours such as irritability, anxiety, and social withdrawal (Nikolov et al. 2009).
Given the lack of consensus on GIS in ASD and given the opportunity of the population-based SNAP study (Baird et al. 2006), this study set out to determine the population-level prevalence by parental report of GI symptoms in ASD both in the past and currently, including symptoms suggestive of possible enterocolitis (Wakefield et al. 1998), when compared with children with other developmental disorders but no ASD or typically developing (TD) children of similar age.

The prevalence of ASDs in the United States continues to rise, and pediatricians are being tasked with the responsibility for universal screening. Further changes in its epidemiology will undoubtedly result from anticipated changes in the diagnostic criteria put forth in the upcoming revision to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (5th edition). Although there have been considerable advances in identifying a genetic cause in many more cases, the cause remains elusive in most cases. Recent studies of concordant twins suggest there is a stronger environmental component than previously believed. Research suggests earlier diagnosis may be feasible in some cases, and a new treatment approach has been shown to be effective in very young children. Although there have not been any large-scale advances in the medical treatment, some isolated successes have been reported and other promising therapies are now being investigated.

These advances were made possible first by the discovery and dissemination of early intensive behavioural intervention (EIBI) for young children with autism that created the impetus for earlier accurate diagnosis. Other factors influencing the rapid growth in autism research were the first accepted diagnostic test for autism, the Autism Diagnostic Interview and Observation Schedule (ADI and ADOS). Developments in brain imaging and genetic technology combined to create a fuller understanding of the heterogeneity of autism, its multiple aetiologies, very early onset and course, and strategies for treatment. For a significant proportion of children with autism, it appears EIBI may be capable of promoting brain connectivity in specific cerebral areas, which is one of autism's underlying challenges. Disagreements about the most appropriate early intervention approach between developmental and behavioural psychologists have been unproductive and not contributed to advancing the field. Naturalistic behavioural and structured discrete trial methods are being integrated with developmental strategies with promising outcomes. Over these past 30 years, young people with autism have gone from receiving essentially no proactive treatment, resulting in lives languishing in institutions, to today, when half of children receiving EIBI treatment subsequently participate in regular classrooms alongside their peers. The future has entirely changed for young people with autism. Autism has become an eminently treatable condition.

The Summit of Independent European Vaccination Experts (SIEVE) recommended in 2007 that efforts be made to improve healthcare workers’ knowledge and beliefs about vaccines, and their attitudes towards them, to increase vaccination coverage. The aim of the study was to compile and analyze the areas of disagreement in the existing evidence about the relationship between healthcare workers’ knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about vaccines and their intentions to vaccinate the populations they serve.
Methods
We conducted a systematic search in four electronic databases for studies published in any of seven different languages between February 1998 and June 2009. We included studies conducted in developed countries that used statistical methods to relate or associate the variables included in our research question. Two independent reviewers verified that the studies met the inclusion criteria, assessed the quality of the studies and extracted their relevant characteristics. The data were descriptively analyzed.
Results
Of the 2354 references identified in the initial search, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The diversity in the study designs and in the methods used to measure the variables made it impossible to integrate the results, and each study had to be assessed individually. All the studies found an association in the direction postulated by the SIEVE experts: among healthcare workers, higher awareness, beliefs that are more aligned with scientific evidence and more favorable attitudes toward vaccination were associated with greater intentions to vaccinate. All the studies included were cross-sectional; thus, no causal relationship between the variables was established.
Conclusion
The results suggest that interventions aimed at improving healthcare workers’ knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about vaccines should be encouraged, and their impact on vaccination coverage should be assessed.",“Discussion”;Middle Section;;,"Consequently, there may be a risk of publication bias. One limitation was that we chose to include only the studies that started collecting data after the publication of the article by Wakefield et al.

In spite of the success of vaccines over the last two centuries, parents (and also some health care workers) gloss over the devastating consequences of diseases, which are now avoided thanks to vaccines, and direct their attention to possible negative effects of immunization. Three immunological objections are raised: vaccines cause antigenic overload, natural immunity is safer and better than vaccine-induced immunity, and vaccines induce autoimmunity. The last point is examined in this review. Theoretically, vaccines could trigger autoimmunity by means of cytokine production, anti-idiotypic network, expression of human histocompatibility leukocyte antigens, modification of surface antigens and induction of novel antigens, molecular mimicry, bystander activation, epitope spreading, and polyclonal activation of B cells. There is strong evidence that none of these mechanisms is really effective in causing autoimmune diseases. Vaccines are not a source of autoimmune diseases. By contrast, absolute evidence exists that infectious agents can trigger autoimmune mechanisms and that they do cause autoimmune diseases.","“First instructive history: thefraudulent paper on the relationship between measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism”;Middle Section;;","In The Lancet in 1998 Wakefield et al. described twelve children with intestinal disorders, loss of language and of acquired skills.

Health practitioners play a pivotal role in providing patients with up-to-date evidence and health information. Evidence-based practice and patient-centred care are transforming the delivery of healthcare in the UK. Health practitioners are increasingly balancing the need to provide evidence-based information against that of facilitating patient choice, which may not always concur with the evidence base. There is limited research exploring how health practitioners working in the UK, and particularly those more autonomous practitioners such as health visitors and practice nurses working in community practice settings, negotiate this challenge. This research provides a descriptive account of how health visitors and practice nurses negotiate the challenges of communicating health information and research evidence in practice.
Methods
A total of eighteen in-depth telephone interviews were conducted in the UK between September 2008 and May 2009. The participants comprised nine health visitors and nine practice nurses, recruited via adverts on a nursing website, posters at a practitioner conference and through recommendation. Thematic analysis, with a focus on constant comparative method, was used to analyse the data.
Results
The data were grouped into three main themes: communicating evidence to the critically-minded patient; confidence in communicating evidence; and maintaining the integrity of the patient-practitioner relationship. These findings highlight some of the daily challenges that health visitors and practice nurses face with regard to the complex and dynamic nature of evidence and the changing attitudes and expectations of patients. The findings also highlight the tensions that exist between differing philosophies of evidence-based practice and patient-centred care, which can make communicating about evidence a daunting task.

","In-utero exposure to valproic acid (VPA) has been known as a potent inducer of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), not only in humans, but also in animals. In addition to the defects in communication and social interaction as well as repetitive behaviors, ASD patients usually suffer from gastrointestinal (GI) prob- lems. However, the exact mechanism underlying these disorders is not known. In this study, we examined the gross GI tract structure and GI motility in a VPA animal model of ASD. On embryonic day 12 (E12), 4 pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subcutaneously injected with VPA (400 mg/kg) in the treatment group, and with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in the control group; the resulting male offspring were analyzed at 4 weeks of age. VPA exposure decreased the thickness of tunica mucosa and tunica muscu- laris in the stomach and ileum. Other regions such as duodenum, jejunum, and colon did not show a signif- icant difference. In high-resolution microscopic observation, atrophy of the parietal and chief cells in the stomach and absorptive cells in the ileum was observed. In addition, decreased staining of the epithelial cells was observed in the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained ileum section. Furthermore, decreased motility in GI tract was also observed in rat offspring prenatally exposed to VPA. However, the mecha- nism underlying GI tract defects in VPA animal model as well as the association between abnormal GI structure and function with ASD is yet to be clearly understood. Nevertheless, the results from the present study suggest that this VPA ASD model undergoes abnormal changes in the GI structure and function, which in turn could provide beneficial clues pertaining to the pathophysiological relevance of GI compli- cations and ASD phenotypes.

Parental decision making about childhood vaccinations is complex and the vaccination schedule ever-changing. Vaccination may be controversial even in countries with historically high vaccination rates such as Scotland. Health behaviour models have aided understanding of individual vaccine intentions for specific vaccines. These are limited in explaining actual behaviours and are divorced from the impact of socio-cultural contexts on vaccination decision making.
Purpose
To explore vaccination views in Scotland amongst parents, teenage girls and health professionals across three controversial vaccines: the Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR), the Human Papilloma virus (HPV) and the Influenza A (H1N1) vaccine.
Method
We used qualitative interviews and focus group discussions in a purposive sample of health professionals (n = 51), parents (n = 15) and teenage girls aged 12–15 years (n = 8) about their views of these vaccines. Discussions were analysed using thematic analysis.
Results
Two main themes are highlighted: ‘vaccine risks revisited’ in which we explored how the MMR legacy resurfaced and how worries about vaccine safety permeated the data. ‘Vaccine responsibilities’ indicated tensions regarding roles and responsibilities for vaccines. An overarching notion of ‘just that little bit of doubt’ referred to lingering doubts and uncertainties interwoven across the vaccines.
Conclusions
Public health authorities should remain alert towards pervasive vaccine concerns. It is important for authorities to clarify vaccine roles and responsibilities in the face of new and existing vaccines and to acknowledge public concerns regarding vaccine safety.","Introduction;;

Following international trends, the HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine was introduced in Europe for protection against infection from common strands of the HPV virus which can lead to cervical cancer. Young women aged 18–26 years are at greatest risk of infection by the HPV virus yet have been neglected in research, policy, and practice.
Purpose
To explore young women's constructions of the HPV vaccine in four European countries with different implementation policies ranging from national school-based programmes, regarded as the gold standard, to regional on-demand and private provision.
Method
Qualitative methods comprising 11 focus group discussions with 54 young women aged 18–26, in Scotland (n = 10), Spain (n = 25), Serbia (n = 9) and Bulgaria (n = 10). A discursive analysis was conducted, following an initial thematic analysis.
Results
Two competing discursive constructions were considered: the 'responsible young woman' discourse was constructed as someone with individual rights to health, choice and discretion along with responsibilities to protect health and make rational decisions. In 'the HPV vaccine: a discourse of exclusion', access to the vaccine, wider health promotion and knowledge was controlled by others which had the potential to undermine the young woman's health. We consider how young women managed this tension through recourse to being health vigilant.

In risk communication, boomerang effects have so far been primarily addressed and shown for warnings in fields such as alcohol, nicotine, and drug use prevention. Boomerang effects of all-clear messages on en- vironmental risks have so far not been demonstrated. Based on this observation, this article essentially makes three points. First, the most prominent theoretical ex- planations for boomerang effects do not preclude all-clear messages to have this type of effect. Second, it presents an experiment that demonstrates the existence of a boomerang effect of an all-clear message on the risk from cell phone tower radiation. Respondents who were very worried about this risk before the experi- ment said on average that reading a short all-clear message increased their worries. Third, if this type of boomerang effect is also found for other than radiation risks, people worried about environmental risks (including those worried without a rea- sonable cause) would be hard to convince they need not worry.

Mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) are serious diseases that can lead to potentially fatal illness, disability and death. However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness.
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects associated with the MMR vaccine in children up to 15 years of age.
Search methods
For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, PubMed (July 2004 to May week 2, 2011) and Embase.com (July 2004 to May 2011).
Selection criteria
We used comparative prospective or retrospective trials assessing the effects of the MMR vaccine compared to placebo, do nothing or a combination of measles, mumps and rubella antigens on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality of the included studies. One review author arbitrated in case of disagreement.
Main results
We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one controlled clinical trial (CCT), 27 cohort studies, 17 case‐control studies, five time‐series trials, one case cross‐over trial, two ecological studies, six self controlled case series studies involving in all about 14,700,000 children and assessing effectiveness and safety of MMR vaccine. Based on the available evidence, one MMR vaccine dose is at least 95% effective in preventing clinical measles and 92% effective in preventing secondary cases among household contacts.
Effectiveness of at least one dose of MMR in preventing clinical mumps in children is estimated to be between 69% and 81% for the vaccine prepared with Jeryl Lynn mumps strain and between 70% and 75% for the vaccine containing the Urabe strain. Vaccination with MMR containing the Urabe strain has demonstrated to be 73% effective in preventing secondary mumps cases. Effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR in preventing laboratory‐confirmed mumps cases in children and adolescents was estimated to be between 64% to 66% for one dose and 83% to 88% for two vaccine doses. We did not identify any studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR in preventing rubella.
The highest risk of association with aseptic meningitis was observed within the third week after immunisation with Urabe‐containing MMR (risk ratio (RR) 14.28; 95% confidence interval (CI) from 7.93 to 25.71) and within the third (RR 22.5; 95% CI 11.8 to 42.9) or fifth (RR 15.6; 95% CI 10.3 to 24.2) weeks after immunisation with the vaccine prepared with the Leningrad‐Zagreb strain. A significant risk of association with febrile seizures and MMR exposure during the two previous weeks (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15) was assessed in one large person‐time cohort study involving 537,171 children aged between three months and five year of age. Increased risk of febrile seizure has also been observed in children aged between 12 to 23 months (relative incidence (RI) 4.09; 95% CI 3.1 to 5.33) and children aged 12 to 35 months (RI 5.68; 95% CI 2.31 to 13.97) within six to 11 days after exposure to MMR vaccine. An increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR immunisation in children aged 12 to 23 months was assessed in one case‐control study (RR 6.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 30.1) and in one small self controlled case series (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 5.38; 95% CI 2.72 to 10.62). Increased risk of thrombocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR exposure was also assessed in one other case‐control study involving 2311 children and adolescents between one month and 18 years (odds ratio (OR) 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7). Exposure to the MMR vaccine was unlikely to be associated with autism, asthma, leukaemia, hay fever, type 1 diabetes, gait disturbance, Crohn's disease, demyelinating diseases, bacterial or viral infections.

We introduce a new visual analytic method for analyzing, comparing, and contrasting characteristics of publication portfolios. The new method introduces a novel design of dual‐map thematic overlays on global maps of science. Each publication portfolio can be added as one layer of dual‐map overlays over 2 related, but distinct, global maps of science: one for citing journals and the other for cited journals. We demonstrate how the new design facilitates a portfolio analysis in terms of patterns emerging from the distributions of citation threads and the dynamics of trajectories as a function of space and time. We first demonstrate the analysis of portfolios defined on a single source article. Then we contrast publication portfolios of multiple comparable units of interest; namely, colleges in universities and corporate research organizations. We also include examples of overlays of scientific fields. We expect that our method will provide new insights to portfolio analysis.","“Examples of Dual‐Map Overlays”;Middle Section;;

","Introduction: The measles virus is a major human pathogen responsible for approximately 150,000 deaths annually. The disease is vaccine preventable and eradication of the virus is considered feasible, in principle. However, a herd immunity exceeding 95% is required to prevent sporadic viral outbreaks in a population. Declining disease prevalence, combined with public anxiety over the vaccination's safety, has led to increased vaccine refusal, especially in Europe. This has led to the resurgence of measles in some areas.
Areas covered: This article discusses whether synergizing effective measles therapeutics with the measles vaccination could contribute to finally eradicating measles. The authors identify key elements in a desirable drug profile and review current disease management strategies and the state of experimental inhibitor candidates. The authors also evaluate the risk associated with viral escape from inhibition, and consider the potential of measles therapeutics in the management of persistent central nervous system (CNS) viral infection. Finally, the authors contemplate the possible impact of therapeutics in controlling the threat imposed by closely related zoonotic pathogens of the same genus as measles.
Expert opinion: Efficacious therapeutics used for post-exposure prophylaxis of high-risk social contacts of confirmed index cases may aid measles eradication by closing herd immunity gaps; this is due to vaccine refusal or failure in populations with overall good vaccination coverage. The envisioned primarily prophylactic application of measles therapeutics to a predominantly pediatric and/or adolescent population, dictates the drug profile. It also has to be safe and efficacious, orally available, shelf-stable at ambient temperature and amenable to cost–effective manufacturing.",“Potential for measles eradication”;Middle Section;;,"Public reservations against the measles vaccine can be traced to two major sources: concerns about vaccination safety, and religious and moral concerns.

While much of science is concerned with the effects of causes (EoC), relying upon evidence accumulated from randomized controlled experiments and observational studies, the problem of inferring the causes of effects (CoE) requires its own framing and possibly different data. Philosophers have written about the need to distinguish between the “EoC” and “the CoE” for hundreds of years, but their advice remains murky even today. The statistical literature is only of limited help here as well, focusing largely on the traditional problem of the “EoC.” Through a series of examples, we review the two concepts, how they are related, and how they differ. We provide an alternative framing of the “CoE” that differs substantially from that found in the bulk of the scientific literature, and in legal cases and commentary on them.

Specifically, this argument enables the lay person to bridge gaps in knowledge and arrive at judgements about public health problems by attending to certain logical and epistemic features of expertise. The extent to which lay people are able to discern these features is considered by examining the results of a study of public health reasoning in 879 members of the public.",“CONCLUDING REMARKS”; Conclusions;;,"For example, if the purpose of public health communication is to warn of possible health risks associated with the use of the oral contraceptive pill, “the public” in this case consists of women of child-bearing age who are using, or plan to use, this form of contraception.

The emphasis is on models that explain behaviour as individually driven and cognitively motivated, with health beliefs framed as the favoured mechanisms to target in order to bring about change to improve health. Utilising understandings exemplified in critical health psychology, we take a more socially situated approach, focusing on practicing health, the rhetoric of modernisation in UK health care and moves toward democratisation. While recognising that within these new ways of working there are opportunities for empowerment and user‐led health care, there are other implications. How these changes link to simplistic cognitive behavioural ideologies of health promotion and rational decision‐making is explored. Utilising two different empirical studies, this article highlights how self‐management and expected compliance with governmental authority in relation to health practices position not only communities that experience multiple disadvantage but also more seemingly privileged social actors. The article presents a challenge to self‐management and informed choice, in which the importance of navigational networks is evident.

Meta-analyses have suggested that in some domains, such as psychology, up to a third of the studies could be unreliable due to such biases. A series of experiments demonstrates that while people are aware of the possibility that scientists can be more biased when the conclusions of their experiments fit their initial hypotheses, they robustly fail to appreciate that they should also be more sceptical of such results. This is true even when participants read descriptions of studies that have been shown to be biased. Moreover, participants take other sources of bias—such as financial incentives—into account, showing that this bias neglect may be specific to theory-driven hypothesis testing.

This paper focuses on an exploration of mothers’ engagement with advice around the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Much of the previous literature utilises a ‘decision-making’ framework, based on ‘risk assessment’ whereby mothers’ decisions are conceptualised as rooted in complex belief systems, and supposes that that by gaining an understanding of these systems, beliefs and behaviour can be modified and uptake improved. However, less attention has been paid to the ways in which mothers negotiate such advice or the ways in which advice is mediated by positionings, practices and relationships. Analysis of data from a focus group with five mothers identified three themes: (i) Sourcing advice and information, (ii) Constructing ‘Mother knows best’ and (iii) Negotiating agency. Despite the trustworthiness of advice and information being questioned, an awareness of concerns about the MMR, and health professionals being constructed as remote, ultimate conformity to, and compliance with, the ‘system’ and ‘society’ were described as determining MMR ‘decisions’.","“Mothers, responsibility and immunisation”;First Section;;","One such ‘choice’ is in relation to the mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination.

Maximising household vaccination in these places is key. Evidence suggests that while vaccinator performance generally, and physical access related to security, create blockages in the vaccination supply-side, unwillingness to be vaccinated by small groups of households and communities constitutes the principal demand-side barrier. The question is why. Culture has been treated as a dominant factor determining resistance to vaccination in the global programme. Resistance, often occurring in areas with substantial Muslim population, has been associated with fear and rumour fuelled by ignorance, and religious objection – problematically merged in a religio-cultural interpretation of resistance as a kind of Islamic obscurantism. Yet attitudes to the polio programme appear to vary substantially within small geographic areas. Rather than being a matter of common belief, public orientation appears to be shaped by a combination of religio-cultural and more localised socio-economic and political factors – in particular, the potentially aggressive nature of mass vaccination, and the perceived under-supply of other development goods. Interpreting resistance to vaccination as essentially religio-cultural marginalises an understanding of resistance as the rational and strategic response by households and communities to systematic conditions of inequity and exclusion.",“Culture and health: vaccines and resistance”;Middle Section;;,"Riots attending attempts to enforce smallpox vaccination in Europe and the United States in the nineteenth century (Casiday, 2005; Greenough, 1995; Taylor, 2009) drew on perceptions of abrogated indi- vidual freedom, and inappropriate intrusion into the private sanctity of the family and household decision-making by the state (as well as fears of economic displacement among the practitioners of pre-vaccine forms of variolation). European instances of vaccine rejection (for pertussis in the 1970s and the MMR jab in the 2000s) drew on peer-reviewed scientific literature (however poorly generated and irresponsible) (Kulenkampff & Schwartzman, 1974; Wakefield et al., 1998). 
Even the downright conspiratorial views of vaccination – in the author’s experience views which have been avidly cited throughout the global polio programme with a con- sistency between countries that suggests an institutional preference for such explana- tions rather than a continuous reality across diverse contexts – draw in some cases on an echo of historical experience.

The present study focuses on a salient mental disability—autism—to advance current scholarship about representations of disabilities in the news. Stigmatizing cues and framing techniques from news coverage of autism over a period of approximately 15 years suggest that journalists may be creating a threatening space for autism, particularly through the perpetuation of stigmatic cues in more than two-thirds of news coverage of autism, coupled with the selection of certain news frames.

","Vaccination has made an enormous contribution to global health. Two major infections, smallpox and rinderpest, have been eradicated. Global coverage of vaccination against many important infectious diseases of childhood has been enhanced dramatically since the creation of WHO's Expanded Programme of Immunization in 1974 and of the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunization in 2000. Polio has almost been eradicated and success in controlling measles makes this infection another potential target for eradication. Despite these successes, approximately 6.6 million children still die each year and about a half of these deaths are caused by infections, including pneumonia and diarrhoea, which could be prevented by vaccination. Enhanced deployment of recently developed pneumococcal conjugate and rotavirus vaccines should, therefore, result in a further decline in childhood mortality. Development of vaccines against more complex infections, such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV, has been challenging and achievements so far have been modest. Final success against these infections may require combination vaccinations, each component stimulating a different arm of the immune system. In the longer term, vaccines are likely to be used to prevent or modulate the course of some non-infectious diseases. Progress has already been made with therapeutic cancer vaccines and future potential targets include addiction, diabetes, hypertension and Alzheimer's disease.","“2.

“2. Past contribution of vaccination to global health”;Middle Section;;","Consequently, the incidence of these infections as important public health problems declined substantially, although in the case of pertussis and measles, success has not been complete as outbreaks of these infections still occur in industrialized countries, including the UK, owing to periodic declines in vaccine coverage. These declines in coverage are often a consequence of the activities of an active anti-vaccination lobby, as was the case in the UK following the spurious reports of a link between autism and a combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine [14]. The measles virus has a high reproductive potential, and a high, sustained level of vaccine coverage is required to interrupt transmission.;;
Both widely used rotavirus vaccines cause the serious condition of intussusception in a small proportion of vaccine recipients, perhaps one to five additional episodes per 100 000 vaccines, an acceptable risk considering the major reduction in hospital admissions and deaths achieved with these vaccines [21]. The issue of true vaccine side effects needs to be separated from incorrect claims such as the reported association between MMR vaccine and autism [14], and such false claims vigorously rebutted.","Cites for information;;

“Conclusion”;Conclusions;;","The vast majority of scientific research never gains much attention beyond a small community of interested scientists and engineers, but in 1998, the prestigious British medical journal The Lancet published an article that continues to garner attention 15 years later, even after being repudiated by most of those involved in its publication and officially retracted by the publishing journal (Wakefield et al., 1998). In an early report case study of 12 children, Wakefield and 12 coauthors announced evidence of gastrointestinal issues in children who showed developmental regression despite previous normal progress.;;
Parents, fearing a link between vaccination and autism, decide not to vaccinate their children, and, as a result, diseases once nearly eliminated through successful vaccination programs begin reappearing. 
In this article, I conduct a rhetorical analysis of the original Wakefield et al. (1998) article to better understand the discursive origins of the AVC. Although the Wakefield et al. article typically is cited as the source of the AVC (as noted above), no close rhetorical analysis of this infamous text yet exists.;;
A rhetorical analysis of the Wakefield et al. article and its expert readers can shed insight into how this article managed to pass successfully through the peer-review process. 
Since the AVC has been receiving attention for almost 15 years, examining the Wakefield et al. (1998) article only scratches the surface of the complex rhetorical dynamics of this science-based controversy, but such an effort presents an important first step in understanding the broader discursive terrain surrounding it. Whereas many rhetorical aspects of this contro- versy deserve study—such as the press conference (Deer, n.d.) at which Wakefield catapulted the MMR-autism issue into the media spotlight—a full exploration of the controversy is too complex to be discussed here.;;
It will also provide insight into the role peer review can unwittingly play in the creation of such science-based controversies. 
In this article, I show how Wakefield et al. (1998) sufficiently followed the discursive norms and requirements of scientific research articles, especially through the use of hedging and passive voice. These rhetorical choices aid the article in successfully passing through the peer review process to be published as part of the scientific record. ;; 
@@5@@;;
This study builds from the work of other scholars (Hyland 1996; Myers, 1990) who also have traced the role of rhetoric in the acceptance of scientific research articles by peer reviewers. Additionally, the Wakefield et al. (1998) article reads like a typical research article, which makes it all the more essential to determine what rhetorical elements enabled it to serve as the point of origin for the AVC. I argue that Wakefield incorporated enough strategic ambiguity into the scientific text to allow for a broad reading of the article, providing sufficient context for his later claims questioning the safety of the MMR vaccine, thus setting up the seemingly typical article to serve as the discursive foundation for the broader controversy. ;;
I begin by considering the rhetorical aspects of science-based controversies. Then, through a close examination of the original Wakefield et al. (1998) article, I reveal how the text supports multiple readings. I look to reception discourse from Wakefield’s colleagues following the article’s publication to outline the two dominant readings that emerged. ;;
Rather than employing the personal, technical, and public spheres as ontologically accurate divisions of the discursive world, I view them as helpful descriptions to identify the interpretive frames one might take in evaluating arguments or interpreting artifacts. In this article, I apply the notion of technical spheres and public spheres to understand the different readings of the Wakefield et al. (1998) article that emerge. I show how Wakefield took advantage of the different contexts of the technical and public spheres.;; 
The difference in interpretation depends on whether readers interpret the article in a technical sphere context or a public sphere context. 
To support the claim that the Wakefield et al. (1998) article invited multiple interpretations, my analysis considers some of the reception discourse surrounding the article’s publication. Ceccarelli (2001) encouraged rhetorical scholars to consider intertextual elements such as book reviews, articles citing the primary text, interviews, and newspaper articles when conducting a rhetorical analysis because these texts allow a rhetorical critic to not only recognize the invitation a text’s structure provides but also to examine the text’s influence.;; 
Wander (1976) argued, ‘‘The archetypal speaking situation for the scientist occurs in addressing an audience of fellow scientists, and the archetypal form of discourse is the research report’’ (p. 230). Through rhetorical features such as avoiding absolute statements, using passive voice, and incorporating hedges, the Wakefield et al. (1998) article maintained the discursive traditions of the research report that supported a reading of the article as scientifically sound. These rhetorical choices helped the article pass through the significant hurdle of peer review. As Myers (1990) stated, ‘‘In most academic fields, and certainly in all fields of biology, every claim that counts, however renowned the originator, must appear in a journal that makes decisions on the reports of referees’’ (pp. 63–64). ;;
@@10@@;;
Authors must carefully construct claims to be acceptable to reviewers while still making a noteworthy contribution (Myers, 1990, p. 67). The Wakefield et al. (1998) article successfully maintained scientific standards of proof and aligned with professional norms for making claims, as evidenced by its publication. Given the limited amount of data reported, the article contained clear denials of having met scientific standards for showing a causal connection between MMR and ASD. ;;
Given the limited amount of data reported, the article contained clear denials of having met scientific standards for showing a causal connection between MMR and ASD. Most specifically, the article stated, ‘‘We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described,’’ which explicitly denied the existence of a link (Wakefield et al., 1998, p. 641). Wakefield followed this statement with a description of the insufficiency of current data that might support such a link and ended the article by calling for more research. ;;
Words such as ‘‘suggest,’’ ‘‘possibly,’’ and ‘‘may’’ work rhetorically to soften the level of certainty of a statement with the intention of making it more acceptable to (potentially critical or at least skeptical) reviewers.Hedges appear throughout the Wakefield et al. (1998) article. For example, the following 
excerpt contains several (and I have noted these with italics): ;; 

Such language emphasizes the tenuous nature of the ideas being presented. 
Another statement from the discussion section also contains hedging (indicated with italics): ‘‘These studies, together with our own . . . support the hypothesis that the consequences of an inflamed or dysfunctional intestine may play a part in behavioural changes in some children’’ (Wakefield et al., 1998, p. 639). The most apparent hedge in this statement comes from the phrase ‘‘may play a part,’’ which actually includes two hedging moves. ;;


This cautious hedging allows Wakefield to discuss the possibility of a link without overstepping the data presented in the report or appearing overly confident. 
Wakefield et al. (1998) also included hedging when making calls for future investigations. Toward the end of the article he stated (with hedges in italics), If there is a causal link between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and this syndrome, a rising incidence might be anticipated after the introduction of this vaccine in the UK in 1988. Published evidence is inadequate to show whether there is a change in incidence. (p. 640) ;;

@@15@@;;

Additionally, most of the hedges included in the Wakefield et al. article occurred in the discussion section, wherein authors ‘‘speculate’’ and ‘‘extrapolate’’ from their findings and point to the larger significance of their work (Salager-Meyer, 1994). 
The claims presented within the Wakefield et al. (1998) article regarding the possibility of a link between the MMR and autism, given their placement in the discussion section of the article and the presence of hedges to mark them as speculative rather than declarative, fall within the norms of scientific discourse. However, as Hyland (1996) pointed out, hedges ‘‘are likely to express several meanings simultaneously’’ (p. 449). ;;
As I will show later in greater detail, the polysemous nature of these hedged statements in the Wakefield et al. article allowed for an alter- nate interpretation of the article, one that led to the AVC and to more than a decade of debate regarding the safety of childhood immunization. 
Other norms of scientific discourse presented in the Wakefield et al. (1998) article grant the same style and tone as a typical research article while creating further opportunities for multiple interpretations of the text to emerge. Wakefield wrote this article in passive voice.;;
Additionally, Wakefield’s word choice in the article creates a subtle message regarding the connection between the MMR and autism. At one point in the article, he stated, ‘‘Rubella virus is associated with autism and the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (rather than monovalent measles vaccine) has also been implicated’’ (Wakefield et al., 1998, p. 640). Words such as ‘‘linked,’’ ‘‘associated,’’ and ‘‘implicated’’ frequently appear in sentences discussing the MMR vaccine and its involvement in the syndrome Wakefield described in the article. Although Wakefield may deny proving a relationship between MMR and ASD, his word choice scattered throughout the article subtly implied that a link does, indeed, exist. ;;

A key passage in the article contains several of the various rhetorical strategies explored above, demonstrating how they function to make the article seem to simultaneously declare and deny a causal link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Early in the discussion section, the Wakefield et al. (1998) article reads, 
Intestinal and behavioral pathologies may have occurred together by chance, reflecting a selection bias in a self-referred group; however, the uniformity of the intestinal pathological changes and the fact that previous studies have found intestinal dysfunction in children with autistic-spectrum disorders suggests that the connection is real and reflects a unique disease progress. (p. 639) ;;

Significantly, this passage introduces a shift in the overall article; what follows becomes much more speculative as Wakefield leads the reader from a discussion about a possible link between bowel problems and ASD into a hypothetical exploration of why the MMR vaccine might be the causal factor at work. 
Given these carefully constructed claims and cautiously hedged comments, readers clearly see how the Wakefield et al. (1998) article came to be interpreted as claiming that a link between autism and the MMR existed. At the press conference to promote the article, Wakefield made explicit what was implicit in the published text. ;;

@@20@@;;

Shortly after the Wakefield et al. (1998) article’s initial publication and the related press confer- ence, two distinct interpretations of the article emerged among scientists, for the most part dictated by the context within which individuals read the article. As Fahnestock (1986) noted, ‘‘Much of the relevance of scientific articles is extratextual, not spelled out in the discourse but supplied by context, by the assumed inferences the intended audience will make’’ (p. 278). ;;

The first interpretation of the Wakefield et al. (1998) article argued that it did more harm than good to public health in the way it hinted at a causal link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Those supporting such a reading challenged whether the article should have been published, based on its scientific shortcomings as well as its potentially negative impact on public health.;;

But rather than reading the hedges in the Wakefield et al. article as a way of introducing ideas in a scientifically responsible and acceptable way (their traditional use in a technical context), Chen and DeStefano interpreted them like a nontechnical audience would, as more declarative than speculative. 
Others in the scientific community would also apply this mixed reading strategy to the Wakefield et al. (1998) article. Less than a month after publication, The Lancet published seven letters in the correspondence section commenting on the publication of the article (Beale, 1998; Bedford et al., 1998; Black, Prempeh, & Baxter, 1998; Lee et al., 1998; Lindley & Milla, 1998; O’Brien, Jones, & Christie, 1998; Payne & Maxon, 1998). ;;

However, there are enough references in the text to lead the reader to the assumption that there is sufficient evidence provided by the study, and by other scientific publications, to suggest that there is a likely (although as yet unproven) link. (p. 905) 
The writers of this letter directly acknowledged that the Wakefield et al. (1998) article explicitly denied proving a link, but they argued that the article, as written, contained hints that implicitly assert the existence of such a link. The hedged statements noted in the analysis above created these hints, and for these commentators, the implicit message they identified made the article problematic, regardless of any denial it contained, because of the potential for this underlying message to dominate public interpretation. ;;

A second interpretation of the article emerged in the responses provided to these critiques of the Wakefield et al. (1998) article. These responses justified the decision to publish the study and defended the article as not making a claim regarding a link between MMR and autism. ;;

@@25@@;;

He began by declaring, ‘‘The paper by Andrew Wakefield and colleagues is an example of how researchers, editors and those concerned with the public’s health can work together to present new evidence in a scientifically balanced and careful way [emphasis added]’’ (p. 908). Horton placed the Wakefield et al. (1998) study firmly within the realm of science, describing it as an exemplar for maintaining scientific commitments while addressing issues with public relevance. He read the hedged statements in the discussion section in a technical context, interpreting them as a cautious presentation of new ideas. ;;

The respondents who defended the Wakefield et al. (1998) article (Horton, 1998; Murch, Thomson, & Walker-Smith, 1998; Wakefield, 1998) took the article at face value. They read it in the context of a technical sphere and assumed a technical reader who would understand the limitations of the study and also be familiar with how to interpret the hedges contained in the article. ;;

Myers (1990) argued, ‘‘The fate of a claim is not decided when it is published, even when it is published in Nature or Science; it depends on who reads it, how it is read, and how it is used’’ (p. 100). In the media, the claims of the Wakefield et al. (1998) article were, for the most part, read as determining a link between MMR and autism (e.g., see BBC, 1998; Bedford & Elliman, 1998; ‘‘MMR vaccination comes,’’ 1998; Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, 1998). (For more recent examples, see de Lange, 2011; Godlee, Smith, & Marcovitch, 2011; Shapiro, 2011.) ;;

In one article (Bedford & Elliman, 1998), the first sentence noted, ‘‘The media excitement and public concern after a Lancet report linking [emphasis added] measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine with autism kindles a sense of de ́ja` vu’’ (p. 715). Despite the denial in the Wakefield et al. (1998) article, this news story described the article as establishing a link. Meanwhile, the BBC News story carried the headline ‘‘Child Vaccine Linked [emphasis added] to Autism’’ (BBC, 1998).;; 

These headlines and lead-ins dropped the hedges of the original article, broadening Wakefield’s qualified, speculative claims about the possibility of a link to declarative statements about the existence of such a connection. 
Yet another interpretation of the Wakefield et al. (1998) article surfaced in 2004 when journalist Brian Deer published an investigative report that raised doubts about the study by uncovering a conflict of interest on Wakefield’s part (see Deer, 2004, 2011a, 2011b, 2011c). Deer’s report revealed that, while conducting the 12-child case study, Wakefield received money from a lawyer building a legal case against MMR manufacturers for parents of autistic children (Deer, 2011b, p. 136). ;;

@@30@@;;

That same year, 10 of Wakefield’s 12 original coauthors issued a ‘‘Retraction of an Interpretation’’ to explicitly renege the suggestion of a link between MMR and autism (Murch et al., 2004). 
Six years later, The Lancet officially retracted the Wakefield et al. (1998) article, stating, 
It has become clear that several elements of the 1998 paper by Wakefield et al. are incorrect . . . the claims in the original paper that children were ‘‘consecutively referred’’ and that investigations were ‘‘approved’’ by the local ethics committee have been proven to be false (Editors of The Lancet, 2010, p. 445). ;;

Part of the continuing influence of the Wakefield et al. (1998) article comes from Wakefield’s utilization of the very norms of scientific writing—particularly hedges and passive voice—in combination with strategic word choice to create an ambiguous text open to conflicting interpre- tations. Thus, this article illuminates the potential harm associated with the very practices of science publication practices meant to protect it from authorizing unproven claims. ;;

This observation notes the central place of publication in the expansion of scientific knowledge. However, as evidenced by the Wakefield et al. (1998) article, publication represents only the beginning in the rhetorical life of scientific knowledge. As I have shown, what is cited or credited to a particular article occasionally may differ significantly from what is explicitly printed. ;;

As the ongoing debate over the AVC illustrates, scientists may need to think more carefully about the different interpretations of their claims that might emerge among different audiences in different contexts. 
Additionally, the case of the Wakefield et al. (1998) article draws attention to problems with the increasing tendency of scientists to bypass community checks and engage in ‘‘science by press conference’’ (Moore, 2006). The discursive gaps created by hedging may be easy to take advantage of as information passes from a technical context into a public context, such as when promoting scientific publications through press conferences. ;;

Studying the reception of the AVC among the public may be one particularly promising place to start. 
The role of the Wakefield et al. (1998) article in the origins of the AVC reveals the importance of scientific peer review not just in monitoring the expansion of scientific knowledge but also in influencing the ebb and flow of public discourse about science. ;;

“The psychology of vaccine hesitancy”;Middle Section;;","How- ever, the success of these programs has been challenged recently by the rapid dissemination of anti-vaccination information. Perhaps the most famous examples of this include concerns related to whether the MMR vaccine causes autism as suggested by a since withdrawn arti- cle in the Lancet [4–6], and fears about the thi- merosal preservative being associated with autism, a claim that has also been dispro- ven [6,7]. Despite public health officials and sci- entific evidence disputing these allegations, the rapid spread of anti-vaccination beliefs and their persistence led to a decline in vaccine coverage and subsequent outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases.;;
In the past, the ability of anti- vaccination lobby groups to communicate with these individuals was limited due to public health’s control over most of the major sources of information dissemination. However, as illustrated by the MMR and thi- merosal examples, this has now changed [4–7]. The best mech- anism for public health officials to influence individuals between the two extremes remains uncertain, but there are some factors that we do know are important. ;;

Decision aids for decisions regarding childhood immunisation appear to be effective in achieving an increase in vaccine uptake but their cost effectiveness is unknown.
Aim To assess the cost effectiveness of a web-based decision aid to increase uptake of the MMR vaccine.
Design and setting Economic evaluation conducted alongside a cluster randomised controlled trial using urban GP practices in the north of England.
Method Fifty GP practices in the north of England were randomised to one of three trial arms: decision aid, leaflet, usual practice. A total of 220 first-time parents (child aged 3–12 months) were recruited. Parents self-reported their contacts with the NHS and other previous/expected resource utilisation; associated costs were calculated. Vaccine-uptake data were collected from GP practices. A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken and provided the incremental cost per first-vaccine uptake. Multiple imputation was used to account for missing data and findings were adjusted for baseline differences in parents’ levels of decisional conflict regarding MMR vaccination.
Results Of the 220 first-time parents recruited to the study, 179 completed the baseline and post-intervention questionnaires. MMR uptake was highest for those receiving the decision aid (42 out of 42, 100%) versus usual practice (61 out of 62, 98%) and leaflet arm (69 out of 75, 92%), and was associated with lower cost (–£9.20 versus usual practice and –£7.17 versus leaflet).
Conclusion The decision aid has a high chance of being cost effective, regardless of the value placed on obtaining additional vaccinations. It also appears to offer an efficient means of decision support for parents.","Introduction;;

","The number of retracted scientific articles has been increasing. Most retractions are associated with research misconduct, entailing financial costs to funding sources and damage to the careers of those committing misconduct. We sought to calculate the magnitude of these effects. Data relating to retracted manuscripts and authors found by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) to have committed misconduct were reviewed from public databases. Attributable costs of retracted manuscripts, and publication output and funding of researchers found to have committed misconduct were determined. We found that papers retracted due to misconduct accounted for approximately $58 million in direct funding by the NIH between 1992 and 2012, less than 1% of the NIH budget over this period. Each of these articles accounted for a mean of $392,582 in direct costs (SD $423,256). Researchers experienced a median 91.8% decrease in publication output and large declines in funding after censure by the ORI.

For example, a now-discredited article purporting a link between vaccination and autism (Wakefield et al., 1998) helped to dissuade many parents from obtaining vaccination for their children. Decreasing vaccination rates are often associated with outbreaks of preventable infections, such as a recent measles outbreak in Wales that resulted in more than 1200 cases and cost an estimated £470,000 (∼$800,000 US) (McWatt, 2013)

","Context
This article examines trends in state‐level childhood vaccine policies in the United States from 1998 to 2012 and explains the trajectories for both vaccine‐critical and proimmunization legislative efforts. Successful mobilization by vaccine critics during the height of the autism and thimerosal scares (roughly 1998 to 2003) yielded a few state‐level expansions for the most permissive type of exemption from vaccine mandates for public school attendance, those based on personal beliefs. Vaccine‐critical positions, however, have largely become discredited. How has vaccine critics’ ability to advance preferred policies and prevent the passage of unfavorable legislation changed over time?
Methods
We created a unique data set of childhood vaccine bills (n = 636), introduced from 1998 to 2012 across the 50 state legislatures, and coded them by type of effort (exemption, mandate, mercury ban, and information policies) and outcome. We then mapped out the trends in vaccine policies over time. In order to contextualize the trends we identified, we also reviewed numerous primary sources and conducted interviews with stakeholders.
Findings
In general, we found that vaccine critics’ legislative success has begun to wane. In only 20 bills in our data set were vaccine critics able to change policy in their preferred direction via the legislative process. Only 5 of those wins were significant (such as obtaining a new philosophical exemption to vaccine mandates), and the last of these was in 2007. Critics were more successful at preventing passage of proimmunization legislation, such as mandates for the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.
Conclusions
Recent legislation in California, Oregon, and Washington that tightened philosophical exemptions by means of informational requirements suggests that vaccine politics may be entering another phase, one in which immunization supporters may be able to counter increasing opt‐out rates, particularly in states with recent outbreaks and politicians favoring science‐based policies.","Introduction;;
","During the last 15 years, there has been great controversy in the United States over childhood vaccine policy. This controversy was initially sparked by a paper—later retracted by The Lancet1—and press conference comments by British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield in which he speculated that the measles component of the MMR (measles‐mumps‐rubella) vaccine was associated with autism. Also, in the United States, the revelation that a mercury‐based preservative, thimerosal, was present in vaccines at levels that could exceed 1 of 3 different regulatory standards prompted its removal from the US vaccine supply.2",credits;;,neutral;;,yes;;,
2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0105153,doi.org,The Effect of Measles on Health-Related Quality of Life: A Patient-Based Survey,"Background
Measles is a highly contagious and potentially fatal illness preventable through vaccination. Outbreaks in the UK and many other European countries have been increasing over recent years, with over 3,207 laboratory-confirmed cases reported by Public Health England from January 2012 to the end of June 2013. To aid rational decision making regarding measles control versus other use of healthcare resources, it is important to measure the severity of measles in units that are comparable to other diseases. The standard metric for this in the UK is the quality-adjust life year (QALY). To our knowledge, the impact of measles on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in terms of QALYs has not been quantified.
Methods and Findings
Individuals with confirmed measles were sent questionnaires requesting information on the short-term impact of the illness on their HRQoL using the EuroQol EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. HRQoL was reported for the day the questionnaire was received, the worst day of infection and at follow-up three weeks later. 507 questionnaires were sent to individuals with confirmed measles with 203 returned (40%). The majority of respondents were not vaccinated. The mean time off work or school was 9.6 days. The mean duration of perceived illness was 13.8 days. The mean number of QALYs lost was 0.019 (equivalent to 6.9 days). The overall burden of disease in terms of QALYs lost in England based on the total number of confirmed cases in the twelve month period from 1st June 2012 was estimated to be 44.2 QALYs.
Conclusion
The short-term impact of measles infection on HRQoL is substantial, both at the level of the individual patient and in terms of the overall disease burden. This is the first attempt to quantify QALY-loss due to measles at a population level, and provides important parameters to guide future intervention and control measures.","Introduction;;

This has also been recognised at a political level, leading the European Council of Ministers in 2009 to encourage coverage of 75% seasonal influenza vaccine in HCWs. Although there are policies, recommendations and well-tolerated vaccines, still many HCWs refuse to get vaccinated. This article uses literature from psychology and behavioural economics to understand vaccination decisions and the specific situation of HCWs. HCWs are expected to be highly motivated to protect others. However, their individual vaccination decisions follow the same principles (of weighting individual risks) as everyone else’s vaccination decisions. This will lead to decisional conflict in a typical social dilemma situation, in which individual interests are at odds with collective interests. Failure to get vaccinated may be the result. If we understand the motivations and mechanisms of HCWs’ vaccine refusal, interventions and campaigns may be designed more effectively.

process of vaccination in upper-class and highly educated families. 
METHODS: A qualitative approach based on in-depth interviews with 15 couples from the city of Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, falling into three categories: vaccinators, late or selective vaccinators, and nonvaccinators. The interpretation of produced empirical material was performed through content analysis. 
RESULTS: The study showed diverse and particular aspects surrounding the three groups’ decisions whether to vaccinate their children. The vaccinators’ decision to vaccinate their children was spontaneous and raised no questions. Most late or selective vaccinators experienced a wide range of situations that were instrumental in the decision to delay or not apply certain vaccines. The nonvaccinator’s decision-making process expressed a broader context of both criticism of hegemonic obstetric practices in Brazil and access to information transmitted via social networks and the internet. The data showed that the problematization of vaccines (culminating in the decision to not vaccinate their children) occurred in the context of humanized birth, was protagonized by women and was greatly influenced by health information from the internet. 
CONCLUSIONS: Sociocultural aspects of the singular Brazilian context and the contemporary society were involved in the decision-making on children’s vaccination. Understanding this process can provide a real basis for a deeper reflection on health and immunization practices in Brazil in light of the new contexts and challenges of the world today.

“Discussion”","The spread of antivaccine movements via social networks, internet, and media as well as the greater visibility of certain vaccines’ adverse effects has affected vaccine acceptance, particularly in some developed countries.24 The modern antivaccine movement reemerged in England in 1998 following a paper published by Wakefield et al,23 which reported a link between administration of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, and autism and colitis/bowel disease. The publication of this article generated a flurry of media attention and hype, culmi- nating in an immediate decrease in vaccine coverage, and consequently, new measles outbreaks in many coun- tries.3;;
In contrast, the weight of information regarding vaccines and the vari- ation between the full acceptance position of vaccinators and the questioning position of nonvaccinators are consis- tent with the findings reported in international studies.4,14,19 
Our findings showed little correlation between the deci- sion-making in not vaccinate and fear of autism and its possible relation to the vaccine MMR, as reported in European literature3,4,9,14,15,18,19,24 on the theme that has as highlight the impact of Wakefield’s study.23 However, significant findings are shared with the international liter- ature such as, between selective and nonvaccinators, the great influence of pediatricians who follow a nonbiomed- ical orientation and the search for other sources of infor- mation beyond that conveyed by the pediatrician.","credits;;

Australia has made a significant contribution to world knowledge on vaccine‐preventable diseases. Certain deadly diseases have disappeared or become rare in Australia following successful introduction of vaccines. As diseases become rarer, public knowledge about the diseases and their serious consequences has decreased, and concerns about potential vaccine side effects have increased. To maintain confidence in immunisations, sharing of detailed information about the vaccines and the diseases we are trying to prevent is integral to the continued success of our public health programme. Modern quality immunisation programmes need to communicate complex information to immunisation providers and also to the general community. Improving immunisation coverage rates and eliminating the gap in coverage and timeliness between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non‐Indigenous people has become a high priority.","“Immunisation Safety and Adverse Events”;Middle Section;;

This is partly not only due to new additions in the list of recommended vaccines but also due to the use of new, safer, but more expensive technologies in vaccine production and distribution. In recent years, many states have mandated that recommended childhood vaccines be covered by private health insurance companies. Currently, there are 33 states with such a mandate. In this paper, I examine whether the introduction of mandates on private insurers affected immunization rates. Using state and time variation, I find that mandates increased the immunization rate for three vaccines—the diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis, polio, and measles–mumps–rubella vaccines—by about 1.8 percentage points. These results may provide a lower bound for the expected effect of the Affordable Care Act, which mandates coverage of childhood vaccines for all private insurers in the USA.

","Effective communication of science to the general public is important for numerous reasons, including support for policy, funding, informed public decision making, among others. Prior research has found that scientists participating in public policy and public communication must frame their communication efforts in order to connect with audiences. A frame is the mechanism that individuals use to understand and interpret the world around them. Framing can encourage specific interpretations and reference points for a particular issue or event; especially when meaning is negotiated between the media and public audiences. In this study, we looked at the effect of framing within an environmental conservation context. To do this we had survey respondents rank common issues, among them being environmental conservation, from most important to least important for the government to address. We framed environmental conservation using three synonymous terms (environmental security, ecosystem services, and environmental quality) to assess whether there was an effect on rankings dependent on how we framed environmental conservation. We also investigated the effect of individuals' personality characteristics (identity frame) on those environmental conservation rankings. We found that individuals who self-identified as environmentalist were positively associated with ranking highly (most important) environmental conservation when it was framed as either environmental quality or ecosystem services, but not when it was framed as environmental security. Conversely, those individuals who did not rank themselves highly as self-identified environmentalists were positively associated with environmental conservation when it was framed as environmental security. This research suggests that framing audience specific messages can engender audience support in hot-button issues such as environmental conservation and climate change.

Most academic studies of vaccine resistance online use quantitative methods to describe misinformation on vaccine-skeptical websites. Findings from these studies are useful for categorizing the generic features of these websites, but they do not provide insights into why these websites successfully persuade their viewers. To date, there have been few attempts to understand, qualitatively, the persuasive features of provaccine or vaccine-skeptical websites. 
Objective: The purpose of this research was to examine the persuasive features of provaccine and vaccine-skeptical websites. The qualitative analysis was conducted to generate hypotheses concerning what features of these websites are persuasive to people seeking information about vaccination and vaccine-related practices. 
Methods: This study employed a fully qualitative case study methodology that used the anthropological method of thick description to detail and carefully review the rhetorical features of 1 provaccine government website, 1 provaccine hospital website, 1 vaccine-skeptical information website focused on general vaccine safety, and 1 vaccine-skeptical website focused on a specific vaccine. The data gathered were organized into 5 domains: website ownership, visual and textual content, user experience, hyperlinking, and social interactivity. 
Results: The study found that the 2 provaccine websites analyzed functioned as encyclopedias of vaccine information. Both of the websites had relatively small digital ecologies because they only linked to government websites or websites that endorsed vaccination and evidence-based medicine. Neither of these websites offered visitors interactive features or made extensive use of the affordances of Web 2.0. The study also found that the 2 vaccine-skeptical websites had larger digital ecologies because they linked to a variety of vaccine-related websites, including government websites. They leveraged the affordances of Web 2.0 with their interactive features and digital media. 
Conclusions: By employing a rhetorical framework, this study found that the provaccine websites analyzed concentrate on the accurate transmission of evidence-based scientific research about vaccines and government-endorsed vaccination-related practices, whereas the vaccine-skeptical websites focus on creating communities of people affected by vaccines and vaccine-related practices. From this personal framework, these websites then challenge the information presented in scientific literature and government documents. At the same time, the vaccine-skeptical websites in this study are repositories of vaccine information and vaccination-related resources. Future studies on vaccination and the Internet should take into consideration the rhetorical features of provaccine and vaccine-skeptical websites and further investigate the influence of Web 2.0 community-building features on people seeking information about vaccine-related practices.","Introduction;;

Yet evidence suggests that policy makers and medical practitioners do not always have a good understanding of the practices and relevant beliefs of ASD-afflicted individuals’ carers who often follow questionable recommendations and adopt advice poorly supported by scientific data. The key goal of the present work is to explore the idea that Twitter, as a highly popular platform for information exchange, could be used as a data-mining source to learn about the population affected by ASD—their behaviour, concerns, needs, etc. To this end, using a large data set of over 11 million harvested tweets as the basis for our investigation, we describe a series of experiments which examine a range of linguistic and semantic aspects of messages posted by individuals interested in ASD. Our findings, the first of their nature in the published scientific literature, strongly motivate additional research on this topic and present a methodological basis for further work.

2015,10.1080/10810730.2015.1018605,Other,Source Credibility and the Biasing Effect of Narrative Information on the Perception of Vaccination Risks,"Immunization rates are below the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy established by the World Health Organization. One reason for this are anti-vaccination activists, who use the Internet to disseminate their agenda, frequently by publishing narrative reports about alleged vaccine adverse events. In health communication, the use of narrative information has been shown to be effectively persuasive. Furthermore, persuasion research indicates that the credibility of an information source may serve as a cue to discount or augment the communicated message. Thus, the present study investigated the effect of source credibility on the biasing effect of narrative information regarding the perception of vaccination risks. 265 participants were provided with stat- istical information (20%) regarding the occurrence of vaccine adverse events after vaccination against a fictitious disease. This was followed by 20 personalized narratives from an online forum on vaccination experiences. The authors varied the relative frequency of narratives reporting vaccine adverse events (35% vs. 85%), narrative source credibility (anti-vaccination website vs. neutral health forum), and the credibility of the statistical information (reliable data vs. unreliable data vs. control) in a between-subjects design. Results showed a stable narrative bias on risk perception that was not affected by credibility cues. However, narratives from an anti-vaccination website generally led to lower perceptions of vaccination risks. 
","Introduction;;
","As perceived risk has been shown to be a reliable predictor of vaccination behavior (Brewer et al., 2007), this lacking awareness of risky diseases may contribute to the low vaccination rates. In addition, many individuals focus on the risk of vaccine adverse events—first, because the absolute frequency of vaccine adverse events (VAE) increases with the number of individuals receiving vaccines (Chen, 1999) and, second, because anti-vaccination activists propagate severe alleged VAE, for example, the refuted myth that the MMR-vaccination may lead to autism (The Lancet, 2010; Wakefield et al., 1998). A typical strategy of anti-vaccination activists is to promote emotional narratives from and about individuals, preferably children, who have allegedly been harmed by vaccinations (Kata, 2010, 2012).

Reflecting this trend, more medical schools now require applicants to have taken an undergraduate course in introductory statistics. Given the breadth of statistical applications, we should cover in that course certain essential topics that may not be covered in the more general introductory statistics course. In selecting and presenting such topics, we should bear in mind that doctors also need to communicate probabilistic concepts of risks and benefits to patients who are increasingly expected to be active participants in their own health care choices despite having no training in medicine or statistics. It is also important that interesting and relevant examples accompany the presentation, because the examples (rather than the details) are what students tend to retain years later. Here, we present a list of topics we cover in the introductory biostatistics course that may not be covered in the general introductory course. We also provide some of our favorite examples for discussing these topics.

Claims that this indicates a broad conservative distrust of science have been countered by assertions that while conservatives might oppose the scientific consensus on climate change or evolution, liberals oppose scientists on some other domains such as vaccines. Evidence for disproportionately liberal bias against science on vaccines has been largely anecdotal, however. Here, we test this proposition of opposite biases using 2014 survey data from Oregon and New Hampshire. Across vaccine as well as climate change questions on each of these two surveys, we find that Democrats are most likely to say they trust scientists for information, and Tea Party supporters are least likely, contradicting the proposition of opposite bias. Moreover, partisan divisions tend to widen with education. Theoretical explanations that have been offered for liberal trust or conservative distrust of science in other specific domains such as climate change or environmental protection fit less well with these results on vaccines. Given the much different content of climate change and vaccine issues, the common political pattern appears more consistent with hypotheses of broader ideological divisions on acceptance of science.

The court found all of the causation theories presented to be untenable and did not award damages to any parents. We analyze the Omnibus Autism Proceedings as a struggle within the scientific field between the scientific orthodoxy of the respondents and the heterodox position taken by the plaintiffs, suggesting that the ruling in these cases helped to shore up hegemony on autism causation. Drawing on the literature on non-knowledge, we suggest that only the respondents had enough scientific capital to strategically direct non-knowledge toward genetic research, thereby foreclosing the possibility of environmental causation of autism. The plaintiffs, who promote a non-standard ontology of autism, suggest that the science on autism remains undone and should not be circumscribed. In analyzing the Omnibus Autism Proceedings with field theory, we highlight the way in which scientific consensus-building and the setting of research agendas are the result of struggle, and we show that the strategic deployment of non-knowledge becomes a major stake in battles for scientific legitimacy and the settling of scientific controversies.

Quality of care is strongly influenced by evidence-based medicine, a large part of which is based on results obtained from clinical trials. If trials are conducted in secret, patient safety is at risk. Several mandates—legal, editorial, financial, and ethical—have tried to influence the disclosure of clinical trials, first by encouraging registration in publicly accessible registers and, second, by calling for the publication of results. Not all these initiatives have reached high rates of compliance, but the succession of national and international events over a few years gave an important boost to information disclosure. This article provides a chronicle of the succession of the events, from the historical calls to the recent EMA policy and WHO statement, and public consultations requested by the NIH, and the HHS, which will inevitably change the international panorama. The path of these new policies is moving towards more supervised clinical research. Individual scientific institutions can also contribute, at the local level, to such an ethical endeavor as is improving research transparency, by disclosing information on the trials coordinated by their own researchers.
Results
The way is long and complex, but, if everyone contributes there could be a prompt, worldwide diffusion of the findings of clinical trials, and therefore a more possible evidenced-based medicine.
",None;;,"Several doubts exist, however, on giving full access to a trial protocol and to the main trial results. Access to such data could give rise to unfounded health scares [40], since independent reviews of data are “vulnerable to distortion” and can lead to important cases such as that of the fraudulent research findings linking the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism [41].
Researchers have reported several examples of discrepancies between protocols and published reports[42] and reported that these changes are often linked to the safety and efficacy outcomes originally mentioned in the trial protocol [43, 44], and that industry funded trials are more often associated with significant primary outcome changes [45].

","Uptake rates for the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine have been below the required 95% in the UK since a retracted and discredited article linking the MMR vaccine with autism and inflammatory bowel disease was released in 1998. This study undertook semi-structured telephone interviews among parents or carers of 47 unvaccinated measles cases who were aged between 13 months and 9 years, during a large measles outbreak in Merseyside. Results showed that concerns over the specific links with autism remain an important cause of refusal to vaccinate, with over half of respondents stating this as a reason. A quarter stated child illness during scheduled vaccination time, while other reasons included general safety concerns and access issues. Over half of respondents felt that more information or a discussion with a health professional would help the decision-making process, while a third stated improved access. There was clear support for vaccination among respondents when asked about current opinions regarding MMR vaccine. The findings support the hypothesis that safety concerns remain a major barrier to MMR vaccination, and also support previous evidence that experience of measles is an important determinant in the decision to vaccinate.

This study was widely criticized [8, 9] and the Medical Research Council reviewed all the evidence regarding MMR vaccine and its links to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the same year, and concluded that there was no evidence to link MMR vaccine to IBD [10–12].;;
Twenty-eight responses mentioned safety concerns, the most common reason provided, and of these 23 specifically referred to autism. These responses were mainly just discussing general links to autism; however, eight responses specifically mentioned the role of the media or the Wakefield study [6], while three responses discussed personal experience of autism with friends or family. Four responses discussed concerns about vaccination side-effects or reactions not specified to autism, while one respondent discussed concerns about a mental health risk.

2015,10.1177/0192623315595884,doi.org,Regulatory Forum Opinion Piece*: The Value of Publishing Negative Scientific Study Data,"Historically it has been easier to publish positive scientific results than negative data not supporting the research hypothesis. This appears to be increasing, with fewer negative studies appearing in the literature across many disciplines. Failure to recognize the value of negative results has important implications for the toxicology community. Implications include perpetuating scientific fields based upon selective or occasionally erroneous, positive results. One example is decreased vaccination rates and increased measles infections that can lead to childhood mortality following one erroneous positive study linking vaccination to adverse effects despite multiple negative studies. Publication of negative data that challenges existing paradigms enhances progress by stopping further investment in scientifically barren topics, decreases the use of animals, and focuses research in more fruitful areas. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) publishes both positive and negative rodent data. Retrospective analysis of the NTP database has provided insights on the carcinogenic process and in the gradual acceptance of using fewer animals in safety studies. This article proposes that careful publication of both positive and negative data can enhance product safety assessment, add robustness to safety determinations in the regulatory decision-making process, and should be actively encouraged by those determining journal editorial policy.","“Negative Data Has Difficulty Correcting Published False Statements”;Middle Section;;

Popular media have responded to this phenomenon by emphasizing refusers’ moral failings and irrational fears. This article explores vaccine skeptics’ objections and argues that their critics miss fundamental reasons for resistances. Drawing on ethnographic research with a community of vaccine skeptics in southern California, a consideration of a leading vaccine researcher’s responses to vaccine critics and an analysis of Jenny McCarthy’s condemnation of current vaccine practices, this research considers why even parents who have accepted some vaccines, but not all, distrust vaccines and their proponents. Parents’ skepticism merits new forms of engagement by physicians and other vaccine advocates. As with any health intervention, vaccines can present some risks to a small number of recipients; when public health and clinical messages minimize parents’ fears, they may increase parental doubt.

Rhetors who argue against a connection between vaccines and autism insist that their opponents are irrational, while rhetors arguing for a link insist that their fears are rational indeed. This analysis poses an alternative way of understanding the vaccines-autism controversy, suggesting that it is partly fueled by differing perceptions of the bound- ary between science and non-science. Using the concept of boundary work as a lens, this article uses generative rhetorical criticism to examine artifacts within the con- troversy and explores rhetorical constructions of scientific evidence, the forum of scientific discourse, scientific expertise, and the scientific capability. The findings suggest that rhetors’ awareness of disciplinary boundaries is just as important in the construction and reception of their arguments as their knowledge of scientific facts and principles.

Related to this, parents against vaccines have arguments to justify their position that physicians cannot force parents to immunize their children.

Data regarding the endoscopic, biological, and pathological examinations performed and the allergic histories for each patient were retrospectively reviewed from the clinical records.
Results
Median age of the patients (four males, three females) was 50 years. Lymphoid hyperplasia was seen in the cecum (n = 5), ascending colon (n = 2), and transverse colon (n = 1). Six patients (85.7 %) had one of the allergic airway diseases: allergic rhinoconjunctivitis for pollen (n = 3), bronchial asthma (n = 1), infantile asthma (n = 1), or allergic bronchitis (n = 1). Drug allergy (n = 3) and urticaria (n = 2) were also found. All seven patients had one or more allergic diseases; however, none had a history of food allergy. Blood tests for allergens revealed that six patients (85.7 %) had positive reactions to inherent allergens, whereas only one patient had a positive reaction to food allergens.

Vaccine uptake in the UK continues to recover after the dip following the notorious—and discredited—Wakefield et al (1998) report on the MMR vaccine. However, in a study of rubella-susceptible pregnant women in South Wales in 2010, Matthews et al (2013) found that almost 40% of a small sample of women whose immunisation records were examined had not received two doses of rubella-containing vaccine; they speculated that the immunisation decisions made by parents may have been influenced by the adverse publicity generated about the MMR vaccine by the Wakefield paper.

Refusal of vaccination is a complicated and multifaceted issue, one that clearly demands a closer look by paediatricians and public health officials alike. While medical doctors and scientists are trained to practice ‘evidence-based medicine’, and studies of vaccine safety and efficacy speak the language of statistics, there is reason to believe that this is not the most effective strategy for communicating with all groups of parents. Herein, we consider other methods such as narrative practices that employ stories and appeal more directly to parents. We also examine how doctors are trained to disseminate information and whether there are reasonable supplementary methods that could be used to improve vaccine communication and ultimately immunisation rates.

Globally, an estimated 20 million cases of measles continue to occur, and it remains a leading cause of death among young children. It is rare in the USA and other first world countries, but numerous outbreaks have occurred in the USA recently, due to a combination of factors including poor vaccine coverage and importation of cases among travelers returning from endemic areas. The diagnosis of measles is usually made clinically, when an individual presents with a constellation of symptoms including cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, high fever, and an erythematous maculopapular rash in a cephalocaudal distribution. Complications are common and include otitis media, pneumonia, encephalitis, and rarely death. A measles vaccine is available in two doses and provides excellent protection against the disease. Despite this, vaccination coverage, especially among young adults, remains poor. Given its resurgence in the USA and other countries, interventions are urgently needed to address low vaccination rates and vaccine hesitancy. Measles awareness should also be a priority among young clinicians, who may have never seen a case or are not familiar with the disease.

A commitment to the overall value of science built on trust is a counter-balance to misconduct. While students may struggle with the why questions, they are important.

Results on existence of equilibria, their local stability, and system persistence are proved. Then, by considering the noteworthy subcase of a piecewise linear ‘prevalence-dependent’ coverage function, the local stability of the endemic state is proved and conditions for its global asymptotic stability are given.

It was included in the official programme of the 20th World Congress on Advances in Oncology and the 18th International Symposium on Molecular Medicine, which attracted over 500 delegates from the five continents. During the Workshop, the topics covered included the challenges of vaccine implementation against human papillomaviruses in countries under financial crisis, strategies for eradicating poliomyelitis and its 60th vaccine anniversary, as well as the debate on the association between autism and vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella. Among the non‑vaccine related topics, emphasis was given to viral infections in prematurely born infants and their long-term outcomes, new paediatric intensive care management options for bronchiolitis related to respiratory syncytial virus, the clinical implications of hepatitis B virus and cytomegalovirus genotyping, the Ebola virus threat and preparedness in Paediatric Emergency Departments, oral, oropharynx, laryngeal, nasal and ocular viral infections and Merkel cell polyomavirus as a novel emerging virus of infancy and childhood.

“Update on current views and advances on Paediatric Virology”;Middle Section;;","Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) include disorders, such as psychomotor regression, language impairment and behavioural social withdrawal, placing patients with ASD in permanent need for healthcare and social support (61). Earlier reports have associated vaccination against MMR with the occurrence of ASD in children (62), thus leading in particularly low vaccination coverage. As a result, outbreaks regarding the vaccine preventable strains have reappeared throughout Europe (63–65), Asia (66,67) and the United States (68,69).;;
However, the loss of credibility of the MMR vaccine remains a concern. This can be partially explained by failure on behalf of the scientific community to effectively communicate: i) the limitations and bias of the original study of Wakefield et al (62) in 1998, ii) the mounting evidence supporting the lack of a causal relationship between MMR vaccine receipt and autism onset, as proven by large epidemiological studies (70–72) and iii) adverse effects of vaccination in the general setting of coincidental, rather than causal associations. Another contributing factor must be attributed to a powerful influence by the public media, such as television, newspapers and internet, regarding MMR vaccination, ultimately leading to a subsequent negative public health response.","cites for information;;

In the first golden age, live, such as Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG), and yellow fever, inactivated, such as typhoid, cholera, plague, and influenza, and subunit vaccines, such as tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, have been developed. In the second golden age, the cell cul- ture technology enabled polio, measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines be developed. In the era of modern vaccines, in addition to the conju- gate polysaccharide, hepatitis A, oral typhoid, and varicella vaccines, the advent of molecular biology enabled to develop hepatitis B, acellular pertussis, papillomavirus, and rotavirus recombinant vaccines. 
Great successes have been achieved in the fight against infectious diseases, including the smallpox global eradication, the nearly disap- pearance of polio, the control of tetanus, diphtheria, measles, rubella, yellow fever, and rabies. However, much work should still be done for improving old vaccines, such as BCG, anthrax, smallpox, plague, or for developing effective vaccines against old or emerging infec- tious threats, such as human-immunodeficiency-virus, malaria, hepatitis C, dengue, respiratory-syncytial-virus, cytomegalovirus, multiresistant bacteria, Clostridium difficile, Ebola virus.

","Mere tolerance of untested, disproven, and pseudoscientific interventions has too often created significant setbacks, immeasurable difficulties, and countless obstacles for children with autism and their families. The professions associated with autism have been plagued by subscription to and application of dubious interventions. New fads arise and dissipate with astonishing speed while disproven methods like facilitated communication regain popularity and unproven interventions like sensory integration proliferate widely. Previous chapters in this text outline various models derived from the scientific process in ways that reflect increasing emphasis on evidence-based practices for improving outcomes of children with autism and their families. However, delimiting these models, the associated methods and strategies, and the underlying theoretical constructs from which they are derived is insufficient for deterring adoption of unproven and disproven interventions. Accordingly, this chapter represents an attempt to contribute to the discussions about why autism continues to be fertile ground for pseudoscientific and fad interventions while also educating readers about conditions that sustain discredited and unproven practices. We overview some fundamental philosophical tenets of science and contrast them with tactics used by snake oil peddlers and charlatans.

2016,10.1111/jcpp.12501,doi.org,Annual Research Review: The role of the environment in the developmental psychopathology of autism spectrum condition,"Background
Although autism spectrum condition (ASC) is strongly genetic in origin, accumulating evidence points to the critical roles of various environmental influences on its emergence and subsequent developmental course.
Methods
A developmental psychopathology framework was used to synthesise literature on environmental factors associated with the onset and course of ASC (based on a systematic search of the literature using PubMed, PsychInfo and Google Scholar databases). Particular emphasis was placed on gene–environment interplay, including gene–environment interaction (G × E) and gene–environment correlation (rGE).
Results
Before conception, advanced paternal and maternal ages may independently enhance offspring risk for ASC. Exogenous prenatal risks are evident (e.g. valproate and toxic chemicals) or possible (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), and processes endogenous to the materno‐foeto‐placental unit (e.g. maternal diabetes, enhanced steroidogenic activities and maternal immune activation) likely heighten offspring vulnerability to ASC. Folate intake is a prenatal protective factor, with a particular window of action around 4 weeks preconception and during the first trimester. These prenatal risks and protective mechanisms appear to involve G × E and potentially rGE. A variety of perinatal risks are related to offspring ASC risk, possibly reflecting rGE. Postnatal social factors (e.g. caregiver–infant interaction, severe early deprivation) during the first years of life may operate through rGE to influence the likelihood of manifesting a full ASC phenotype from a ‘prodromal’ phase (a proposal distinct to the discredited and harmful ‘refrigerator mother hypothesis’); and later postnatal risks, after the full manifestation of ASC, shape life span development through transactions mediated by rGE. There is no evidence that vaccination is a postnatal risk for ASC.
Conclusions
Future investigations should consider the specificity of risks for ASC versus other atypical neurodevelopmental trajectories, timing of risk and protective mechanisms, animal model systems to study mechanisms underlying gene–environment interplay, large‐sample genome–envirome designs to address G × E and longitudinal studies to elucidate how rGE plays out over time.

However, the definition of AEFI is dependent on the vaccines themselves, complicating the definition of an AEFI and explaining why doubts and concerns have been raised. Presently, disease epidemiology data collected in healthy people and in subjects with underlying disease, general vaccine coverage, and the vaccination status of subjects with AEFIs are managed by many independent institutions.

","Engaging patients and the public with evidence is an ethical imperative because engagement is central to respect for persons and will likely improve health outcomes, facilitate the stewardship of resources, enhance prospects for justice, and build public trust. However, patient and public engagement is also morally complex, because evidence alone is never definitive. As patients and the public engage with evidence, value conflicts will arise and must be managed to achieve trustworthy decision making. We outline value conflicts likely to emerge in the following five settings: clinical care, health care organizations, public health, the regulatory context, and among payers. Using a variety of examples, we offer suggestions about how such conflicts may be managed, including providing more opportunities for democratic deliberation and having more explicit community discussion of how to balance personal choice and community well-being, transparent discussions of cost and quality outcomes, and greater patient engagement in community-based participatory research and the governance of learning health systems.

The anesthesia-related manifestations of many VPDs involve airway complications, cardiovascular and respiratory compromise, and unusual neurologic and neuromuscular symptoms.

In about one in 10,000 cases, a published article is retracted. This very often means that the results it reports are flawed. Several authors have voiced concerns about the presence of retracted research in the memory of science. In particular, a retracted result is propagated by citing it. In the published literature, many instances are given of retracted articles that are cited both before and after their retraction. Even worse is the possibility that these articles in turn are cited in such a way that the retracted result is propagated further.
Methods
We have conducted a case study to find out how a retracted article is cited and whether retracted results are propagated through indirect citations. We have constructed the entire citation network for this case.
Results
We show that directly citing articles is an important source of propagation of retracted research results. In contrast, in our case study, indirect citations do not contribute to the propagation of the retracted result.

","An article published in 1998 by Andrew Wakefield1 linked the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine with an increased risk of autism. Over the years, the article garnered extensive media coverage leading to public concerns surrounding the safety of the vaccination, with MMR vaccination rates decreasing across the UK.2;;

These relatively recent outbreaks are thought to largely be due to unvaccinated young teenagers, i.e. children who were not vaccinated around the time of the MMR vaccination scare.4 Other studies were conducted to investigate the potential link between MMR vaccination and autism around the time of the Wakefield1 study, and Gilbert and Hiejbel5 and Taylor et al.6 found no such associations. For more information on a summary of studies failing to find any association linking the MMR vaccine with autism, see Elliman and Bedford.7 ;;

For more information on a summary of studies failing to find any association linking the MMR vaccine with autism, see Elliman and Bedford.7 As a result of this evidence, the Wakefield article1 was partially retracted in 2004, before being fully discredited in 2010.
In this paper, we investigate spatial and temporal trends in estimated MMR susceptibility in Scotland for pre-school children (aged 2.5–4.5 in September) between 1998 and 2014.;;

The aims of this paper are threefold. First, we aim to estimate the magnitude of the increased measles susceptibility associated with the MMR vaccination scare linked to the Wakefield article1 and assess whether susceptibility has decreased in recent years. Second, we assess whether the magnitude of the inequality, as measured by the spatial variability, in measles susceptibility in Scotland increased at the same time and whether spatial variation has subsequently decreased.;;

@@5@@;

 An increase in the proportion of pre-school children susceptible to measles is observed between 1998 and 2004, rising from under 15% to just over 17.5%. This increase coincides with the period in which the now discredited Wakefield article1 linking the MMR vaccination with increased risks of autism picked up traction with the Scottish public. The article was partially retracted in 2004, after which we begin to see a decrease in measles susceptibility. ;;

Spatial maps depicting the mean centred (by year) fitted proportions of children susceptible to measles in Scotland attending pre-school in 1998, 2004, 2008 and 2014 are shown in Figure 7. Measles susceptibility peaks around 2004 – the time the Wakefield article1 linking the MMR vaccination with autism gained media coverage – with the north-west region of Scotland and the remote Shetland islands (far north east) displaying increased susceptibility rates in comparison with the south east. From 2008 onwards, measles susceptibility across Scotland has decreased, with susceptibility rates at their lowest in the past 10 years. ;;

We have presented a spatio-temporal Bayesian hierarchical binomial logistic regression model that allows the magnitude of spatial variability to change over time and the overall temporal trend in disease risk to be estimated. The model was motivated by spatial-temporal data pertaining to the MMR vaccination scare associated with the now retracted Wakefield article,1 which provided an unfounded link between the MMR vaccination and increased risks of autism. The model used in our analysis can be implemented using the CARBayesST package, which was developed in conjunction with this paper and is part of the freely accessible statistical programming language R. We note that CARBayesST can also implement a Poisson log-linear variant of the model.;;

Our intuition for this pattern would be that general practitioners and health centres are less readily accessible in those rural areas,18 so coupled with the negative press associated with the MMR vaccination, parents in those areas would be less likely to get their children vaccinated. Among these cohorts of pre-school children, measles susceptibility decreases from 2006 onwards with susceptibility rates at their lowest by 2014 (see Figure 6) at around 8%, which coincides with the Wakefield article’s1 partial retraction in 2004 before being fully discredited in 2010.
Our results also show no evidence of an increase in spatial inequality in measles susceptibility between affluent and deprived communities as a result of the autism scare, as the spatial variation consistently decreases between 1998 and 2006, rather than showing any increase.;;

MMR uptake rates for children aged five years of age between 1 April and 30 June 2015 are 97.5% and 93.5% for one dose of MMR (MMR1) and two doses of MMR (MMR2), respectively.
The results in this paper relate to global, that is average across Scotland, trends in measles susceptibility associated with the discredited Wakefield paper,1 and our future interest is in identifying local intermediate geography level effects. In particular, we are interested in identifying which intermediate geographies in Scotland were affected by the scare and which were not, using a spatio-temporal mixture model where the components of the mixture are different shaped temporal trends.","describes;;

But sometimes covering multiple sides of a science issue does the audience a disservice. Counterbalancing a truth claim backed by strong scientific support with a poorly backed argument can unnecessarily heighten audience perceptions of uncertainty. At the same time, journalistic norms often constrain reporters to “get both sides of the story” even when there is little debate in the scientific community about which truth claim is most valid. In this study, we look at whether highlighting the way in which experts are arrayed across truth claims—a strategy we label “weight-of-evidence reporting”—can attenuate heightened perceptions of uncertainty that can result from coverage of conflicting claims. The results of our study suggest weight-of-evidence strategies can indeed play a role in reducing some of the uncertainty audiences may perceive when encountering lop-sided truth claims.

Repeated failures to alleviate this ignorance make the problem of vaccine hesitancy seem intractable. I challenge this presumption of knowledge deficit and reinterpret vac- cine hesitancy to be a problem of public mistrust of scientific experts and insti- tutions. This finding invites new corrective measures: self-scrutiny by our scientific and governmental bodies regarding their own credibility as well as investment in dialogical rather than didactic communicative outreach to vaccine hesitant members of the public.

Unlike the social media or news data where the underlying topics evolve over time, the topic nuances in science result in new scientific directions to emerge. Therefore, we model the longitudinal literature data with a new approach that uses topics which remain identifiable over the course of time. Current studies either disregard the time dimension or treat it as an exchangeable covariate when they fix the topics over time or do not share the topics over epochs when they model the time naturally. We address these issues by adopting a non-parametric Bayesian approach. We assume the data is partially exchangeable and divide it into consecutive epochs. Then, by fixing the topics in a recurrent Chinese restaurant franchise, we impose a static topical structure on the corpus such that the topics are shared across epochs and the documents within epochs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a collection of medical literature related to autism spectrum disorder. We collect a large corpus of publications and carefully examine two important research issues of the domain as case studies. Moreover, we make the results of our experiment and the source code of the model, freely available to the public.

Insights from a qualitative study on rotavirus vaccination across select Indian cities,"Key debates on improving vaccination coverage tend to focus on factors that affect uptake in the public health system while ignoring the private sector that plays an important role in providing health services in any low or middle-income country setting. Using in-depth interviews, we explored factors that influenced the decision of parents as well as pediatricians working in the private sector across 8 Indian cities on whether their children should be vaccinated with a particular vaccine Pediatricians and their relationship with parents was an important factor that influenced the decision on whether parents vaccinated their children with a particular vaccine or not. The decision to recommend a vaccine is taken on the principle that it is better to be safe than sorry than on any objective assessment of whether a child requires a particular vaccine or not. Family members and social factors also played a major role in the decision-making. According to some parents, vaccinating their child added an aspirational value to their growth. This is especially true of the newer vaccines that are considered optional in India. The cost of a vaccine did not come up as an inhibiting factor in the decision to vaccinate a child. Access to appropriate evidence was limited for both pediatricians and parents and evidence per se played a minimal role in the final decision to vaccinate a child or not. Far more important were the influences of factors such as relationship with the pediatrician, the role of decisions related to vaccination taken by people in the immediate social network.

Official French health care policy recommends vaccinations against hepatitis B for all infants and at-risk adults. Attendees at our free testing center for sexually transmitted infections (FTC-STI) routinely express hepatitis B vaccine hesitancy. We aimed in this exposed population to explore the extent of knowledge concerning HBV infection, to quantify HBV vaccine refusal, and to identify the reasons for this refusal. Methods. During a 3-month period in 2013, all attendees at the Grenoble FTC-STI were given an anonymous questionnaire exploring their knowledge of hepatitis B, perception of the hepatitis B vaccine, acceptance of free same-day hepatitis B vaccination, and reasons for refusing this offer (where applicable). Results. The questionnaire was completed by 735 attendees (64.7% of those attending during the study period)(59.9% men; age 27.9 ± 9.2). Most respondents identified hepatitis B as a potentially severe, potentially lifelong illness existing in France. Concerning the hepatitis B vaccine, less than 50% totally or mostly agreed that it is safe; when asked whether the vaccine is dangerous, 44.2% answered “I don't know” and 14.0% agreed; when asked whether the vaccine is “not well characterized,” 45.0%, answered “I don't know” and 26.5% agreed. When asked whether they mistrust the hepatitis B vaccine or all vaccines in general, 39.0% and 28.9% of those unvaccinated agreed, respectively. Two thirds refused to get vaccinated on the same day. When asked whether they were afraid of the adverse effects of this vaccine, only 18.7% disagreed. Conclusion. Negative perceptions of the hepatitis B vaccine are widespread in this at-risk population. Consequently, a successful communication strategy must reassure this at-risk population of the vaccine's innocuous nature.

Methods: We analysed 1,342 calls concerning childhood vaccination to an Australian pharmacist‐operated medicines call centre (MCC). Data were available from September 2002 until June 2010. We identified key themes and compared these for callers from high and low immunisation coverage areas.
Results: Most calls related to safety concerns (60.4%), with many questions about vaccine constituents (31.6%). In low immunisation areas, a higher level of concern persisted about vaccine preservatives (mercury and thiomersal) despite their removal from vaccines in 2000. Of specific vaccines, the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine raised most questions (29.9%). Common motivations to call the MCC were ‘inadequate information’ (54%), ‘second opinion’ (21%) ‘conflicting information’ (9%) and ‘worrying symptom’ (6%).

","The debate around the ethics of homeopathy in recent issues of the journal has been approached as a binary question; is homeopathy ethical or not? This paper suggests that this is an unhelpful question and instead discusses a framework to establish the extent to which the dominant (medical) culture should tolerate non-dominant health practices such as homeopathy. This requires a sophisticated understanding of the placebo effect, a critical evaluation of what evidence is available, a consideration of the harm that the non-dominant practice might cause, and a consideration of how this might be affected by the culture of the patient. This is presented as a matter of cultural competence. At a clinical level clinicians need to respect the values and beliefs of their patients and communicate with all the practitioners involved in a patient’s care. At a societal level there are a number of factors to be considered when a community decides which practices to tolerate and to what extent.

Small bowel bacterial overgrowth can both cause and result from gastritis and alter dietary cobalamin absorption. Some bacterial species may produce human-inaccessible cobalamin corrinoids and may create competition for human-accessible cobalamin. Increased human-inaccessible corrinoids from bacterial production may raise the total corrinoid level assessed by the serum total cobalamin, limiting diagnostic utility and masking a deficiency of human-accessible cobalamin. Anaerobic bacteria may reverse the propionic to succinic acid pathway, converting methylmalonic acid back to propionic acid to release CO2; this could raise propionic acid and lower methylmalonic acid levels, limiting its diagnostic utility. Cobalamin deficiency limits enzymatic conversion of homocysteine to methionine and increases homocysteine levels. Increased homocysteine can be reduced by diversion into the transsulfuration pathway, limiting the diagnostic power of this metabolite. Finally, in the delicate balance between folate and cobalamin which regulates DNA synthesis, excess synthetic folate from public health policies can combine with bacterial folate production to mask the macrocytic anemia of cobalamin deficiency. 
Small bowel bacterial overgrowth can increase propionic acid production and reduce cobalamin bioavailability. Both propionic acid administration and cobal- amin deficiency can alter brain fatty acid levels and brain function and cause autistic symptomology. Essential fatty acid ratios can modify gut bacterial species which can, in turn, modify fatty acid composition and inflammation. Omega-3 supplementation can reverse many of the symptoms of propionic acid neurotox- icity. Cobalamin supplementation can raise omega-3 fatty acid levels in the brain and can improve autism symptomology.

Immunizations are one of the most important health interventions of the 20th century, yet people in many areas of the world do not receive adequate immunizations. Approximately 3 million people worldwide die every year from vaccine-preventable diseases; about half of these deaths are young children and infants. Global travel is more common; diseases that were once localized now can be found in communities around the world.
Problem:
Multiple barriers to immunizations have been identified. Healthcare access, cost, and perceptions of safety and trust in healthcare are factors that have depressed global immunization rates.
Interventions:
Several global organizations have focused on addressing these barriers as part of their efforts to increase immunization rates. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The World Health Organization, and the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund each have a part of their organization that is concentrated on immunizations.
Clinical Implications:
Maternal child nurses worldwide can assist in increasing immunization rates. Nurses can participate in outreach programs to ease the burden of patients and families in accessing immunizations. Nurses can work with local and global organizations to make immunizations more affordable. Nurses can improve trust and knowledge about immunizations in their local communities.

Increasing immunization in the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (G&T) community is a key priority for improving health outcomes in this community. This study aimed to explore G&T parents: (1) beliefs about childhood immunization; (2) beliefs about the risks of immunization and non‐immunization; (3) perceived obstacles to, and facilitators of, immunization and (4) views on increasing immunization levels.
Method
A cross‐sectional, qualitative study was conducted comprising of five focus groups with 16 site‐dwelling G&T women with pre‐school aged children. Data were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically.
Results
Five main themes were identified:
Lay understandings of causation and risk;
Timing of immunization;
Children being perceived as vulnerable;
The fit between lifestyle and healthcare provision;
The impact of living with a high burden of disease.

Conclusion
Understanding of the risks and benefits of measles, mumps and rubella immunization did not differ significantly from the wider population or those promoted by the health service. The majority of barriers stemmed from living with the effects of long‐standing health inequalities, which posed further barriers to accessing immunization, and shaped beliefs about immunization. Factors facilitating uptake occurred where access to immunization services was made flexible, e.g. immunization on traveller sites.",Introduction,"Increasing uptake amongst under‐immunized groups has been identified as a key priority for improving health outcomes and reducing health inequalities (Department for Communities and Local Government, 2012; Department of Health, 2012). Immunization for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination fell following a discredited 1998 study positing a link between this vaccine, autism and bowel conditions (Wakefield et al., 1998) but has increased in recent years reaching 92% in 2012–2013. This is still below the 95% coverage required for a population to achieve ‘herd immunity’ (Health and Social Care Information Centre, HSCIC, 2013).",credits;;,neutral;;,no;;,

All US states legally require the vaccination of children prior to school or daycare entry; however, this obligation is accompanied with a system of medical, religious, and/or philosophical exemptions. Nonmedical exemptions became subject of discussion after the 2015 Disneyland measles outbreak in California, which unequivocally brought to light what had been brewing below the surface for a while: a slow but steady decline in vaccination rates in Western societies, resulting in the reoccurrence of measles outbreaks. This can be traced back to an increasing public questioning of vaccines by a growing anti-vaccination movement. In reaction to the outbreak and the public outrage it generated, several states proposed—and some already passed—bills to eliminate nonmedical exemptions.
I analyze two questions. First, can legal exemptions from mandatory childhood vaccination schemes for parents who are opposed to vaccination (still) be justified? Second, should legal exemptions be limited to religious objections to vaccination, or should they also be granted to secular objections? Although the argument in the paper starts from the example of the US, it seeks to provide a more general philosophical reflection on the question of exemptions from mandatory childhood vaccination.",Introduction,"Unlike the more religious groups that are primarily inwardly oriented, this new anti-vaccination movement actively and successfully reaches out to new parents through anti-vaccination websites and TV celebrities.

The use of acetaminophen in babies and young children may be much more strongly associated with autism than its use during pregnancy, perhaps because of well-known deficiencies in the metabolic breakdown of pharmaceuticals during early development. Thus, one explanation for the increased prevalence of autism is that increased exposure to acetaminophen, exacerbated by inflammation and oxidative stress, is neurotoxic in babies and small children. This view mandates extreme urgency in probing the long-term effects of acetaminophen use in babies and the possibility that many cases of infantile autism may actually be induced by acetaminophen exposure shortly after birth.",“Why evaluate the connection between post-partum acetaminophen exposure and autism?”;Middle section;;,"For reasons discussed above, it seems apparent that vaccines are not the underlying cause of the epidemic of autism, but at the same time, if history is any indication, ignoring the perspectives of parents is a grave error.

Yet, if subsequent media coverage reports that those studies have been retracted, are risk perceptions reversed or attenuated? Or, once amplified, do risk perceptions remain elevated? Answering such questions may improve our understanding of risk perceptions of some publicly controversial technologies, for example, childhood vaccines and genetically modified (GM) food. We engage with the social amplification of risk framework, especially scholarship on news media as a risk amplification (or attenuation) station. In a between-subjects experiment, we examine the extent to which perceived risk of GM food is influenced by (a) news of a study reporting that eating GM food causes cancer and/or (b) news of its retraction. Whereas initial news coverage amplified all measured risk perceptions, news of the study’s retraction effectively reversed them to nonamplified levels.","Introduction;;

","While SARF scholars intimate that it is often easier to increase concern and stoke fears than it is to reduce them (Kasperson et al., 1988), we simply lack much research to understand these dynamics.
This knowledge gap is unfortunate given the recent rise in scientific article retractions (Steen, Casadevall, & Fang, 2013; Van Noorden, 2011) and, more on point, the few high-profile cases where eventually discredited and retracted peer-reviewed studies on the health risks of childhood vaccines (Wakefield et al., 1998) and genetically modified organisms (GMOs; Séralini et al., 2012) seem to have inflated public risk perceptions of these technologies. Indeed, often sensationalized media coverage, content sharing via social media, and the claims-making activities of opponents of these technologies have amplified public worry about childhood vaccines (Largent, 2012) and GMOs (Stephan, 2015).;;

While most retractions of scientific articles rarely register outside of the scientific community, a few generate considerable media coverage and garner public attention. Some prominent retractions that have captured considerable public attention in the recent past include articles on the side effects of childhood vaccines (Wakefield et al., 1998), the social cognition of nonhuman primates (Hauser, Weiss, & Marcus, 2002), the creation of multipurpose stem cells (Hwang et al., 2004; Obokata et al., 2014), the health risks of GM crops (Séralini et al., 2012), and change in attitudes about same-sex marriage (LaCour & Green, 2014).

In this study, we investigate retractions from a quantitative perspective, aiming to answer two fundamental questions. One, how do retractions influence the scholarly impact of retracted papers, authors, and institutions? Two, does this influence propagate to the wider academic community through scholarly associations? Specifically, we analyzed a set of retracted articles indexed in Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS), and ran multiple experiments to compare changes in scholarly impact against a control set of nonretracted articles, authors, and institutions. We further applied the Granger Causality test to investigate whether different scientific topics are dynamically affected by retracted papers occurring within those topics. Our results show two key findings: first, the scholarly impact of retracted papers and authors significantly decreases after retraction, and the most severe impact decrease correlates with retractions based on proven, purposeful scientific misconduct; second, this retraction penalty does not seem to spread through the broader scholarly social graph, but instead has a limited and localized effect. Our findings may provide useful insights for scholars or science committees to evaluate the scholarly value of papers, authors, or institutions related to retractions.","Introduction;;

Mass vaccinations and a wave of criticism they cause, forces us to reflect on the limits of medical intervention in the human body and the boundaries granted to individual’s freedom and autonomy. This problem is universal and exists mainly in countries without mandatory vaccinations. Analyzing recent years, it must be underlined that a process in some legislatures has been introduced to enforce various forms of vaccination coercion. Although, refusing vaccinations has been treated liberally, the last wave of epidemics in the United States and Europe forced the creation of a different approach. Gradually in the USA, a duty (not a ‘coercion’) of vaccination is being enforced. Occurring epidemics, (e.g. measles) and dangers resulting from them, force authorities to violate the principle of autonomy and restrict individuals’ freedoms regarding their own body. The article presents legal solutions relating to vaccinations in the United States and Europe i.e. administrative decisions imposing vaccinations, solutions conditioning social existence and financial penalties for not complying with this obligation and proposes a solution based on financial liability that will balance out patients’ autonomy and public security. ",“Discussion”;Final section;;,"Information on mass vac- cination and common sanctions for non-complianceare presented in table 2 [8,25]. The wave of criticism and emerging actions against vaccination obligation was directly associated with Wakefield’s publication, in which he described studies interpreting associations between vaccinations and the occurrence of autism and enteri- tis (which were found to be falsified and subsequently discredited), and Sinclair’s publication ‘Vaccinations-the hidden facts’, which revealed that vaccines may cause a number of side effects and pose other health hazards [26–29].

Rather than consider such studies as failures and disregard the null findings, it is important that these studies be published so that all research is available to the field, which (a) enables valid and complete research syntheses and (b) informs future policy, practice, and research. However, null findings are not always published, leading to the possibility of publication bias, a positively skewed research base, and policy and practices based on incomplete data. This special issue of Behavioral Disorders provides an outlet for methodologically sound studies with null findings. In this introductory article, we provide a context for the special issue by discussing the importance of null findings, the problem of publication bias, and ongoing efforts to publish null findings. ",“The Importance of Null Findings “;Middle section,"When science functions appropriately, false positives are identified and corrected by replication studies with null findings. The body of research studies that disproved the causal link between vaccinations and autism purported by Wakefield et al.’s (1998) study is a prime example of how null findings have worked to identify and correct a false positive finding in special education (see Godlee, Smith, & Marcovitch, 2011). 
Of course, just as it is unwise to determine that a prac- tice is effective on the basis of a single study, concluding that a theory or practice is invalid should follow from multiple methodologically sound studies reporting null findings. ",critiques;;,negative;;,no;;,

Peer review is important to the scientific process. However, the present system has been criticised and accused of bias, lack of transparency, failure to detect significant breakthrough and error. At the British Journal of Surgery (BJS), after surveying authors’ and reviewers’ opinions on peer review, we piloted an open online forum with the aim of improving the peer review process.
Methods
In December 2014, a web-based survey assessing attitudes towards open online review was sent to reviewers with a BJS account in Scholar One. From April to June 2015, authors were invited to allow their manuscripts to undergo online peer review in addition to the standard peer review process. The quality of each review was evaluated by editors and editorial assistants using a validated instrument based on a Likert scale.
Results
The survey was sent to 6635 reviewers. In all, 1454 (21.9%) responded. Support for online peer review was strong, with only 10% stating that they would not subject their manuscripts to online peer review. The most prevalent concern was about intellectual property, being highlighted in 118 of 284 comments (41.5%). Out of 265 eligible manuscripts, 110 were included in the online peer review trial. Around 7000 potential reviewers were invited to review each manuscript. In all, 44 of 110 manuscripts (40%) received 100 reviews from 59 reviewers, alongside 115 conventional reviews. The quality of the open forum reviews was lower than for conventional reviews (2.13 (± 0.75) versus 2.84 (± 0.71), P<0.001).
Conclusion
Open online peer review is feasible in this setting, but it attracts few reviews, of lower quality than conventional peer reviews.",Introduction,"There is, however, also evidence of the failings of conventional peer review, including bias [5–13], failure to identify error and fraud [14–17] and suppression of innovation [18].

For parents with initially positive vaccine attitudes, there was no effect of condition on intent to vaccinate a future child.

Studies published from 1/1/1980 to 1/31/2017 were collected via PubMed. Eligibility included studies with at least ten individuals with ASD that measured GI symptoms or conditions. We excluded review and hypothesis papers. We extracted information on study design, GI symptom ascertainment method, demographics, and ASD diagnostic criteria. From a subset of studies, we extracted GI symptom estimates. Out of a possible 386 titles, 144 were included. The prevalence range for constipation was 4.3–45.5% (median 22%), for diarrhea was 2.3–75.6% (median 13.0%), and for any or more than one symptom was 4.2–96.8% (median 46.8%).

While parental knowledge and attitudes toward both disease and vaccinations are known to influence vaccine uptake, the contribution of these factors toward vaccination rates in NSW populations has not been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge and opinions on measles and MMR vaccine in NSW Central and North Coast regions.
Methods: Parents (n=201) of children <12 years were surveyed with a purpose design survey at public beaches at the Central Coast and community markets at the North Coast.
Results: Eight per cent of respondents reported not immunising their child with MMR vaccine. Most respondents recognised that measles is a highly contagious disease. Non‐immunisers were found to be older, had a lower perceived severity of measles, were less likely to agree with the efficacy and safety of the vaccine, and were more likely to have encountered someone who had suffered side‐effects of the vaccine.
Conclusions: There is considerable concern over safety of MMR vaccine among non‐immunisers.

2017,10.1186/s12998-017-0157-8,doi.org,Appeal to fear in health care: appropriate or inappropriate?,"Aim
This paper examines appeal to fear in general: its perceived positive aspects, its negative characteristics, its appropriate as well as its fallacious use.
Background
Appeal to fear is a commonly used marketing method that attempts to change behaviour by creating anxiety in those receiving a fearful message. It is regularly used in public health initiatives such as anti-smoking, anti-drunk driving campaigns as well as in hypertension awareness campaigns. Some chiropractors appear to use appeal to fear to promote subluxation awareness and thereby encourage the use of chiropractic treatment.
Research supporting its use is equivocal; nevertheless, when used judiciously, appeal to fear probably has sufficient strengths to warrant its continued conditional use. When used to promote care for which there is no supporting evidence, its use is fallacious.
Discussion
Appeal to fear has been used in health promotion campaigns for sixty years or more with the intent of modifying behaviours. While there is evidence to suggest that appeal to fear may motivate some individuals to modify offending behaviour or adopt recommended behaviour there is growing resistance to the use of appeal to fear on ethical and psychological grounds. Using appeal to fear as a tool of persuasion can be valid or fallacious depending on the truth of the premises within the argument.
When used to raise awareness about genuine health concerns such as smoking, drunk driving and hypertension appeal to fear is considered to be a valid approach with certain caveats. However, when appeal to fear, not based on evidence or reason, is used as motivator to get others to accept unnecessary interventions for unproven disorders, the use of appeal to fear is fallacious.
Conclusion
In spite of the evidence against its use, it seems likely that appeal to fear will continue to be used in conjunction with other public awareness initiatives to modify recognized detrimental behaviours such as smoking and drunk driving as well as silent killers such as hypertension. However, when used to promote a treatment that has no evidentiary basis such as subluxation based practice in chiropractic the appeal to fear is a fallacy and must be stopped.",“Examples of appeal to fear”;Middle Section;;,"In example 2, the data do not support the premises rendering the argument invalid and making this appeal to fear fallacious.
The autism-vaccine link began in 1998 with the publication of a descriptive study by Wakefield et al. [5] hypothesising a connection between the development of autism and the 8 children in the study having received a Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccination (MMR) one month previously. In spite of Wakefield et al.’s paper providing no data supporting a causal association between MMR vaccine and autism and a lack of a plausible biological mechanism a world-wide fear emerged [6]. Even though the Wakefield et al. paper was retracted by The Lancet [7], the fear persisted prompting significant well-designed research projects to test the vaccine-autism hypothesis.",critiques;;,negative;;,yes;;,
2017,10.1097/acm.0000000000001897,Other,Beyond Citation Rates: A Real-Time Impact Analysis of Health Professions Education Research Using Altmetrics,"Purpose 
To complement traditional citation-based metrics, which take years to accrue and indicate only academic attention, academia has begun considering altmetrics or alternative metrics, which provide timely feedback on an article’s impact by tracking its dissemination via nontraditional outlets, such as blogs and social media, across audiences. This article describes altmetrics and examines altmetrics attention, outlets used, and top article characteristics for health professions education (HPE) research. 
Method 
Using Altmetric Explorer, a tool to search altmetrics activity, the authors searched for HPE articles that had at least one altmetrics event (e.g., an article was tweeted or featured in a news story) between 2011 and 2015. Retrieved articles were analyzed using descriptive statistics. In addition, the 10 articles with the highest Altmetric Attention Scores were identified and their key characteristics extracted. 
Results 
The authors analyzed 6,265 articles with at least one altmetrics event from 13 journals. Articles appeared in 14 altmetrics outlets. Mendeley (161,470 saves), Twitter (37,537 tweets), and Facebook (1,650 posts) were most popular. The number of HPE articles with altmetrics attention increased 145%, from 539 published in 2011 to 1,321 in 2015. In 2015, 50% or more of the articles in 5 journals received altmetrics attention. Themes for articles with the most altmetrics attention included social media or social networking; three such articles were written as tips or guides. 
Conclusions 
Increasing altmetrics attention signals interest in HPE research and the need for further investigation. Knowledge of popular and underused outlets may help investigators strategically share research for broader dissemination. ",“Discussion”;Final section;;,"Another limitation to using altmetrics, which is also a problem for traditional citation counts, is that a large number of altmetrics events or a high Altmetric Attention Score does not necessarily represent a mark of quality. For example, the infamous 1998 article linking vaccines and autism has an Altmetric Attention Score of 2,216.41 This retracted article continues to receive traditional and altmetrics attention, with three news stories referencing it in March 2017.

It briefly describes the three phases of agricultural development consisting of naturally occurring, cross-bred, and genetically engineered, edited or modified crops, otherwise known as Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). It uses the Best Available Regulatory Science (BARS) and Metrics for Evaluation of Regulatory Science Claims (MERSC) to evaluate the scientific validity of claims applicable to GMO and the Best Available Public Information (BAPI) to evaluate the pronouncements by public media and others. Subsequently claims on health risk, ecological risk, consumer choice, and cor- porate greed are evaluated based on BARS/MERSC and BAPI. The paper concludes by suggesting that labeling of food containing GMO should consider the consumer’s choice, such as the food used by those who desire kosher and halal food. Furthermore, the consumer choice is already met by the exclusion of GMO in organic food.

All vaccines go through stringent safety checks during pre-licensure stage. Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) Surveillance program is an integral part of routine immunization program in India to monitor the vaccine safety in the post licensure phase. Indian AEFI Program: National AEFI surveillance relies on passive surveillance and reporting by the health functionaries and practitioners. Vigorous strengthening of AEFI surveillance has resulted in manifold rise in absolute number of AEFI reports across several reporting units in the country in the last decade. Establishment of National AEFI Secretariat, National Technical Collaborating Centre, and development of risk communication strategy as well as quality management certification are some of the unique aspects of this public health program. All serious AEFI reports undergo a systematic causality assessment as per WHO-algorithm by trained committees. National AEFI surveillance system has forged formal linkages with national pharmacovigilance program, the regulators, and professional bodies. Challenges: The number of the reported serious AEFIs are still far less than the expected numbers. Although the AEFI committees at the district and state levels have been established, a large proportion are far from functional.
