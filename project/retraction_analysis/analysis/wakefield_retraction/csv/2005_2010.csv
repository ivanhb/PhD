This article presents moral arguments relating to conflicts between individual autonomy and collective responsibilities in vaccination decisions with a view to informing and advising health professionals and improving the effectiveness of education policies in avoiding resurgence of endemic measles. Lower population immunity, due to falling uptake, is hastening the need for greater public awareness of the consequences for the population. Vaccination refusals go hand in hand with responsibilities owed to future generations and society in not knowingly contributing to preventable harms. Issues such as parents’ rights are considered and balanced against: collective responsibilities for public health; permissibility of ‘free-riding’; conflicting duties of health professionals; and possible enforcement of vaccination. It is suggested that the arguments may form a persuasive tool for the practice of health professionals involved in informing and supporting parents’ vaccination decisions.

",Background;;,"Additionally, should such a low vaccina- tion rate be maintained, there would be an increased likelihood of a resurgence of measles as an endemic disease, with a low permanent level of infection in the population. 
The recently released research by Wakefield and his colleagues, who claimed to have found evidence of a causal association between MMR and regressive autism and inflammatory bowel disease,9,10 generated a storm of controversy. The result was a fall in uptake rates for immunization using the combined vaccine in the UK. ;;",qualifies;;,neutral;;,no;;,

","Objective. During the second half of the 1990s and the first years of the 2000s a declining coverage for MMR vaccination in two-year-olds was observed in Sweden. The aim was to assess reasons for postponement or non-vaccination. Design. A telephone survey using a structured questionnaire on parents’ attitudes regarding their choice to postpone or abstain from vaccinating their child. Setting. The County of Östergötland in Sweden. Subjects. A total of 203 parents of children who had no registered date for MMR vaccination at a Child Health Centre. Main outcome measures. Parental reasons for non-vaccination. Results. In all, 26 of the 203 children had received MMR vaccination but this had not been registered. Of those not vaccinated, 40% of the parents had decided to abstain and 60% to postpone vaccination. Fear of side effects was the most common reason for non-vaccination in both groups. The main source of information was the media followed by the Child Health Centre. Parents with a single child more often postponed vaccination and those who abstained were more likely to have had a discussion with a doctor or nurse about MMR vaccine. Conclusion. Postponers and abstainers may have different reasons for their decision. The role of well-trained healthcare staff in giving advice and an opportunity to discuss MMR vaccination with concerned parents is very important.

This controversial study, undertaken by Wakefield et al,1 speculates whether the triple vaccine could lead to the regressive developmental disorder ‘autism’, a condition in which a child is unable to relate to people and situations, and may show an obsessive resistance to any change, or it may lead to chronic enterocolitis, Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory bowel condition.1 Wakefield et al’s uncontrolled study, however, was confined to 12 children who were consecutively referred to the department of paediatric gastroenterology with symptoms that included loss of acquired skills and gastrointestinal symptoms. ;;","qualifies;;

","Möllering has argued for sociological research on trust that pays attention to the ‘fine details of interpretation’ and begins from the perspectives of those engaged in relations of trust. In this article we explore what it would mean to take up Möllering’s challenge to explore the interpretative elements of trust and the ‘leaps of faith’ trusting entails.We do this through an empirical study of parental and professional talk about the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination. We examine trust as operating in a number of interrelated ways: as a practice based on knowledge; as a ‘leap of faith’ experienced through relationality and familiarity; as working at a system level; and as shaped by relations of governance and by anxieties to do with the nature of social and technological change. Through this analysis, we suggest how an interpretive approach to thinking about trust is a worthwhile exercise.

","This paper presents an empirical study of public conceptions of responsibility and choice in relation to health protection, and the influence of these upon responses to official information. Two contrasting case studies are used, air pollution and childhood immunisation (specifically the MMR vaccination). The results confirm social networks and everyday experiences, and social normalisation of behaviour as important influences upon learning, responses to information, and the taking of personal action. People require information to support the freedom to make personal choices. However, the two cases illustrate that notions of collective responsibility are weaker, in the case of MMR overridden by personal responsibility, in the case of air pollution being transferred to other institutions. Conclusions are developed relating to information provision in an age promoting individualisation and retraction of government, specifically the need for explicit engagement with the benefits (personal and collective) of health protection measures.

To explore the issues surrounding the falling rates of MMR vaccination following the publication of a controversial study by Wakefield et al.
Design/methodology/approach
In order to take a fresh look at the MMR crisis, the Greek tragedy, Antigone, was used as a “strong plot” to de‐contextualise the underlying social and political issues. In this short paper, two themes are explored that emerge from reading Antigone with respect to the unfolding crisis of public confidence in the MMR vaccine: first, the challenge to government in the form of a decrease in public trust in government and government policies; and second, how such a challenge assumes significance and, arising from that, the question of how one might respond to the challenge.
Findings
The MMR debate throws issues of importance to society into relief – for example, public trust in government and science; and notions of public good versus rational choice in public policy on vaccination, However, much of the debate has been polarised into good versus evil – good and evil being subjective positions that are interchangeable, depending on the side one favours. It is argued that the issues are more complex than this, and are as much to do with political consent and the bargain between citizen and state.
Originality/value
Using “strong plots” to theorise about current issues is powerful because it allows one to explore them from different angles and challenge one's understanding. Antigone provides us with a way of standing back from the MMR crisis and re‐conceptualising the issues to capture the essence of the underlying debate.

","During the last two centuries, the world has seen a substantial increase in the number and availability of vaccines for the prevention of infectious disease. Smallpox vaccine remains the most celebrated vaccine-related achievement in human history, but worldwide reductions in many other diseases including measles, mumps, rubella, polio, diphtheria, and whooping cough (Bordetella pertussis) also illustrate the power of vaccination in controlling outbreaks of contagious diseases. Ironically, as advances in vaccination successfully limit disease outbreaks, the impact that these infectious agents once had on society becomes marginalized. Public confidence in vaccination may erode because of real or perceived risks associated with immunization, and this in turn may lead to lower vaccination coverage and loss of herd immunity. Here, we will discuss some of the elements associated with public perceptions and fear of vaccination and place these into the context of how deadly several vaccine-preventable childhood diseases can be if vaccination coverage is insufficient.

introduction;;","In this review, we will focus on the current concerns that have surfaced regarding a possible association be- tween autism and childhood vaccination. One theory sug- gests that the MMR vaccine may precipitate autism in a subpopulation of vaccinated children (47). The second theory proposes that the mercury-containing preservative, thimerosal, is a vaccine additive that may act as an envi- ronmental trigger for the development of autism (22). ;;
Unfortunately, the fear of contracting these childhood diseases has been displaced by fears of the MMR vac- cine itself. One anecdotal study, based on 12 children with autistic spectrum disorders, has triggered wide- spread fear and concern over the safety of the MMR vac- cine because it questioned whether the vaccine was linked to increased rates of autism in immunized children (47). Since its publication in 1998 (47) and widespread media coverage (32), MMR vaccine coverage in the U.K. de- clined from 91% in 1997 (14) to 82% in 2004 (13), with vaccine coverage as low as 60% in some regions (53). ;;

Together, these two large epi- demiological studies indicate that the mortality rate after MMR vaccination is less than one death per 3.5 million vaccinations, clearly demonstrating the safety of this vac- cine over the potentially lethal consequences of con- tracting natural measles, mumps, or rubella (Fig. 2). 
Despite an exceptionally strong safety record, the use of MMR vaccination came under intense scrutiny after a clinical study published by Wakefield et al. in 1998 (47). These investigators described a chronic enterocolitis in 12 children with autism or other pervasive developmental dis- orders (PDD) (47). ;;

","Background: A causal relationship between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and occurrence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been claimed, based on an increase in ASD in the USA and the UK after introduction of the MMR vaccine. However, the possibility that this increase is coincidental has not been eliminated. The unique circumstances of a Japanese MMR vaccination program provide an opportunity for comparison of ASD incidence before and after termination of the program.
Methods: This study examined cumulative incidence of ASD up to age seven for children born from 1988 to 1996 in Kohoku Ward (population approximately 300,000), Yokohama, Japan. ASD cases included all cases of pervasive developmental disorders according to ICD‐10 guidelines.
Results: The MMR vaccination rate in the city of Yokohama declined significantly in the birth cohorts of years 1988 through 1992, and not a single vaccination was administered in 1993 or thereafter. In contrast, cumulative incidence of ASD up to age seven increased significantly in the birth cohorts of years 1988 through 1996 and most notably rose dramatically beginning with the birth cohort of 1993.
Conclusions: The significance of this finding is that MMR vaccination is most unlikely to be a main cause of ASD, that it cannot explain the rise over time in the incidence of ASD, and that withdrawal of MMR in countries where it is still being used cannot be expected to lead to a reduction in the incidence of ASD.",introduction;;,"Publication of a study claiming a causal relationship between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (Wakefield, 1999; Wakefield et al., 1998) sparked a heated debate, primarily in the USA and UK, which relates not only to the etiology of ASD, but also impacts immunization policy.

","Background. Increasing uptake rates for MMR vaccination requires an understanding of factors leading parents to decide for and against vaccination, particularly in the light of recent developments.
Objective. We investigated factors relevant to immunising and non-immunising parents and the extent to which these factors predicted their decisions.
Methods. The study was conducted in Edinburgh, UK. A two-stage mixed method design was used. Delphi technique elicited parents' views of factors relevant to MMR immunisation. Twenty-six factors identified as relevant were incorporated into a final questionnaire. Using cluster sampling, the final questionnaire was distributed to parents recruited through a group of local nurseries. 110 parents participated: eighty (72.7%) had had their child MMR vaccinated, thirty (27.3%) had refused the vaccine. The factors in the final questionnaire were analysed against vaccination status using a direct binary logistic regression model.
Results. Four factors significantly predicted vaccination status, (prediction toward ‘yes vaccination’). These were the influence of current research (OR = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.07–0.51), the helpfulness of leaflets and information packs (OR = 3.27, 95% CI = 1.38–7.75), the importance of eradication of rubella (OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.01–5.78), and the importance attached to the risk of adverse reactions (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.48–0.87).
Conclusions. Differences between immunising and non-immunising parents lie in the importance attached to four relevant factors. Excluding risk of adverse reactions, these factors have not been previously identified as salient and require to be explored further. Health advice to parents should highlight the identified importance attached to eradicating rubella and explicitly reflect research findings.

introduction;;","Recent developments make this a particularly apposite time to consider parental attitudes towards MMR vaccination of their children. Parental concerns over safety of the vaccine have been clearly visible since the initial suggestion by Wakefield and colleagues1 of a possible link between children's receipt of the vaccine, gastrointestinal disease and autistic-spectrum disorders. Publication of this suggested link was followed by a decline in uptake rates of the combined MMR vaccine across the UK, in some parts to as low as 61.4%.2;;
In this, parental behaviour is consistent with that found in relation to vaccination generally22 and other health behaviours involving perceptions of risks.23
We report here the results of a study of the factors that predict parents' decisions for and against MMR vaccination of their children, in the light of renewed criticism of the Wakefield et al. study.1 In this study we aimed (a) using a ‘bottom-up’ approach, to identify the factors relevant to both immunising and non-immunising parents, and (b) to investigate the extent to which the identified factors predicted immunisation or non-immunisation.;;","credits;;

Disappointment with the poor success in finding the cause and numerous reports on the association of autism with metabolic disorders and on “miracle cures” in a wide variety of medicinal or dietary therapies have led to increasing uncertainty among many doctors and parents about the meaningful diagnosis and treatment guided. This work gives an overview of rare congenital metabolic disorders (“born-born errors of metabolism”) that have been proven (eg phenylketonuria, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome) or likely (eg succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency) with autism- specific symptoms are socialized. As a rule, affected patients have additional neurological symptoms. The examinations necessary for the diagnosis of these congenital metabolic diseases and possible therapeutic measures are presented.

","The identification of the candidate genes for autism through linkage and association studies has proven to be a difficult enterprise. An alternative approach is the analysis of cytogenetic abnormalities associated with autism. We present a review of all studies to date that relate patients with cytogenetic abnormalities to the autism phenotype. A literature survey of the Medline and Pubmed databases was performed, using multiple keyword searches. Additional searches through cited references and abstracts from the major genetic conferences from 2000 onwards completed the search. The quality of the phenotype (i.e. of the autism spectrum diagnosis) was rated for each included case. Available specific probe and marker information was used to define optimally the boundaries of the cytogenetic abnormalities. In case of recurrent deletions or duplications on chromosome 15 and 22, the positions of the low copy repeats that are thought to mediate these rearrangements were used to define the most likely boundaries of the implicated ‘Cytogenetic Regions Of Interest’ (CROIs). If no molecular data were available, the sequence position of the relevant chromosome bands was used to obtain the approximate molecular boundaries of the CROI. The findings of the current review indicate: (1) several regions of overlap between CROIs and known loci of significant linkage and/or association findings, and (2) additional regions of overlap among multiple CROIs at the same locus. Whereas the first finding confirms previous linkage/association findings, the latter may represent novel, not previously identified regions containing genes that contribute to autism.

The objectives of this study were to assess geographical variation in trends in MMR coverage and to identify the factors affecting MMR uptake at population level. Methods: We conducted an ecological study of immunization coverage by second birthday, based on routinely collected data from 1993–2004 for England. Trends in MMR uptake were assessed in 95 District Health Authorities in England over the study period. We investigated the relationship between MMR immunization uptake and deprivation, ethnicity, education, population density, rurality, and socioeconomic class. Results: Since 2000, MMR coverage has declined significantly in virtually all areas of England. Population density and deprivation were both strongly correlated with low MMR uptake. The decline in coverage since 1993–94 was significantly related to the proportion of educated population and was greater in densely populated areas. Conclusion: Decline in MMR coverage now affects most areas of England. The lowest rates of MMR coverage remain in urban areas, particularly in inner cities, which also tend to show high levels of deprivation. Public health resources should continue to target inner city areas, as well as focus on the concerns of the better educated about vaccine safety.

I suggest that we can think of this issue in terms of two different models of responding to the public’s view of such perceived risks. The first model I will call the “public perception” view (PP view) and the second the “public good” view (PG view). The PP view suggests that the public’s perception of any risks is so important that public health policies should be formulated in direct response to knowledge about them. I will consider two possible ethical arguments that might be offered in support of such a view: the first argument is an “autonomy” argument and the second a “consequences” argument. I suggest there are serious problems with both arguments. I then outline an alternative model of public health policy formation that I call the “public good” or PG model. This model focuses on drawing distinctions between the clinical and the public health context, and argues that most of public health policy is primarily concerned with the creation and maintenance of various public goods. This latter fact means that the PP model is inappropriate for public health policy formation.

","Background
Public debate over the safety of the trivalent measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and the resultant drop in vaccination rates in several countries, persists despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness.
Objectives
We carried out a systematic review to assess the evidence of effectiveness and unintended effects associated with MMR.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2004, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2004), EMBASE (1974 to December 2004), Biological Abstracts (from 1985 to December 2004), and Science Citation Index (from 1980 to December 2004). Results from reviews, handsearching and from the consultation of manufacturers and authors were also used.
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were comparative prospective or retrospective trials testing the effects of MMR compared to placebo, do‐nothing or a combination of measles, mumps and rubella antigens on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age. These studies were carried out or published by 2004.
Data collection and analysis
We identified 139 articles possibly satisfying our inclusion criteria and included 31 in the review.
Main results
MMR was associated with a lower incidence of upper respiratory tract infections, a higher incidence of irritability, and similar incidence of other adverse effects compared to placebo. The vaccine was likely to be associated with benign thrombocytopenic purpura, parotitis, joint and limb complaints, febrile convulsions within two weeks of vaccination and aseptic meningitis (mumps) (Urabe strain‐containing MMR). Exposure to MMR was unlikely to be associated with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, autism or aseptic meningitis (mumps) (Jeryl‐Lynn strain‐containing MMR). We could not identify studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR that fulfilled our inclusion criteria even though the impact of mass immunisation on the elimination of the diseases has been largely demonstrated.
Authors' conclusions
The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre‐ and post‐marketing, are largely inadequate.

","This paper details an analysis of BBC reporting of the proposed links between MMR and autism. The study aimed to identify main issues arising from the media reports into the link between MMR and the development of autism, and how these contribute to common understandings about people with autism. The study employed a form of discourse analysis to discuss how the media debates represent people with autism and perceived risks from the MMR vaccination. Sources were collected from the BBC website, and comprised of both Internet pages and reports from radio programmes broadcast by the BBC. The analysis focuses on reports around the time of the British Prime Minister's (and his family's) decision to not disclose whether their youngest son was given the disputed triple vaccine. A key issue arising from the analysis is the ways in which science is used to argue for both the safeness of the vaccine and also the dangerousness of it. Within the media debate of the safeness/dangerousness of the vaccine priority is accorded to the experiences of families who feel directly affected by the dangerousness of the vaccine. Thus whilst scientific explanation retains its powerful position in validating and legitimating the ‘truth’ in this instance experiential knowledge takes priority. The reports draw on parental fear of ‘damage’ to their children, where ‘damage’ is constituted as the onset of autism following vaccination. Implicit within the debate is the notion that an autistic child/adult is less acceptable than a (supposedly) ‘normal’ child. The issues emerging from the analysis are in sharp contrast to our previous research with adults with autism. While the development of an autistic identity is often seen as a problem for parents and ‘experts’ researching autism, such identities can be highly valued by those so labelled.


","introduction;;
introduction;;","There has been debate about whether the frequency of diagnoses of autism has risen since the 1980s and the introduction of the MMR (see Frith 2003). Some commentators have proposed a link between these two issues and conclude that there is a causal link between MMR and the development of autism (Wakefield et al. 1998). The assumption is that the MMR gives rise to a nonspecific gut condition which allows for the absorption of nonpermeable peptides into the body which is hypothesized to lead to the development of autism (see Nicoll et al. 1998 for a critique of this hypothesis).;;
This time period provides a ‘hot spot’ of activity, debate and concern about the MMR vaccination due to the intense media reporting on MMR and the number of research projects investigating the link between MMR and autism at this time. These included a research project (Wakefield et al. 1998) which gave evidence for the link between MMR and the development of autism and Entercolitis syndrome (also termed as the autistic Entercolitis syndrome). In addition there was also high levels of media interest in the actions of the British Prime Minister who was endorsing as the only safe option for children.;;

Few studies have examined the early development of the latter group. This study developed a retrospective measure, the Early Development Questionnaire (EDQ), to collect specific, parent-reported information about development in the first 18 months. Based on their EDQ scores, 60 children with autism between the ages of 3 and 9 were divided into three groups: an early onset group (n= 29), a definite regression group (n= 23), and a heterogeneous mixed group (n= 8). Significant differences in early social development were found between the early onset and regression groups. However, over 50 percent of the children who experienced a regression demonstrated some early social deficits during the first year of life, long before regression and the apparent onset of autism. This group, tentatively labeled ‘delays-plus-regression’, deserves further study.




","introduction;;
Final section; “Discussion”;;","The causes of autistic regression are not known. One hypothesis is that regression is due to complications of infection (DeLong et al., 1981; Gupta et al., 1984), epilepsy or subclinical epileptiform discharges (Stefanatos et al., 2002), vaccination (Wakefield et al., 1998), or environmentally mediated exposures (e.g. mercury: Bernard et al., 2001). A competing theory is that regression, like early onset autism (Bolton et al., 1994), is largely geneti- cally influenced, but that the genes have a later onset of action. ;;
This repli- cates earlier research findings that children with autism do not differ significantly from children with developmental delays in terms of their attachment security (Dissanayake and Crossley, 1997; Rogers et al., 1991). 
The measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccine has received much recent attention after being hypothesized as a potential causal agent in autism (Wakefield et al., 1998). Although this study did not explicitly investigate causal mechanisms underlying regression, parent perceptions of possible precipitating events were collected. ;;

","According to the Autism Society of America, autism is now considered to be an epidemic. The increase in the rate of autism revealed by epidemiological studies and government reports implicates the importance of external or environmental factors that may be changing. This article discusses the evidence for the case that some children with autism may become autistic from neuronal cell death or brain damage sometime after birth as result of insult; and addresses the hypotheses that toxicity and oxidative stress may be a cause of neuronal insult in autism. The article first describes the Purkinje cell loss found in autism, Purkinje cell physiology and vulnerability, and the evidence for postnatal cell loss. Second, the article describes the increased brain volume in autism and how it may be related to the Purkinje cell loss. Third, the evidence for toxicity and oxidative stress is covered and the possible involvement of glutathione is discussed. Finally, the article discusses what may be happening over the course of development and the multiple factors that may interplay and make these children more vulnerable to toxicity, oxidative stress, and neuronal insult.
","introduction;;
Middle section; “Evidence for a Glutathione Deficiency and Oxidative Stress in Children with Autism”;;","Many theories were postulated regarding the underlying cause of autism. For example, autism was implicated to be related to the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (Wakefield et al., 1998, 2000; Wakefield, 2003); mercury in vaccines (Bernard et al., 2002; McGinnis, 2001); immune system dysfunction (Cohly and Panja, 2005; Warren et al., 1990, 1992, 1995; Singh et al., 1993; Weizman et al., 1982); fungal infection (; Shaw, 1996), toxicity (McFadden, 1996); metabolic abnormalities (Waring and Klovrza, 2000; Waring and O'Reilly, 1990; Alberti et al., 1999); and “leaky gut syndrome”(Vantrappen and Geboes, 1993). Most recently, studies have suggested that decreased glutathione levels and increased oxidative stress may play a role in the pathology (James et al., 2004).;;
Low glutathione levels may underlie many of the systemic abnormalities associated with autism. In autism, there is evidence for: (1) oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation; (2) toxicity, such as phenolic compounds (Edelson and Cantor, 1998) and toxic metals (Lonsdale, 2002; Filipek et al., 1999; Eppright et al., 1996; Holmes et al., 2003); (3) immune dysfunction, such as impaired or altered immune response and dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines (Cohly and Panja, 2005; Warren et al., 1990, 1992, 1995); and (4) impaired gastrointestinal integrity, such as epithelial pathology and increase gut permeability (D'Eufemia et al., 1996; Wakefield et al., 1998, 2000; Furlano et al., 2001; Horvath et al. 1999).

","In this review of the research literature on autism, we argue that the application of developmental and neuropsychological perspectives has contributed importantly to the understanding of the core deficits in autism and their underlying neural bases. The three classes of theories postulated to explain the developmental and neuropsychological deficits in autism are considered in terms of the specificity, uniqueness, and universality of these impairments in autism. Because we believe that a primary reason for our lack of understanding of the developmental trajectory in autism stems from our inability to diagnose the syndrome in the first three years of life, research approaches to early identification are discussed, as are longitudinal studies aimed at identifying later-life outcomes and their predictors. In contrast to the progress made in defining the core deficits and arriving at criteria for diagnosis, less progress has been made in identifying the causes of autism and in creating and testing interventions aimed at ameliorating the impairments of autism, possibly because these activities have been less tied to the developmental and neuropsychological models that have enlightened the investigation of core deficits.

","Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to develop a staged theoretical argument regarding whether non‐governmental organisations (NGOs) can be considered responsible and accountable for the direct and indirect consequences, on a wide range of stakeholders, flowing from their advocacy activities.
Design/methodology/approach
The paper is primarily theoretical and conceptual, developing a structured, conditional and staged model illustrated with empirical examples.
Findings
The paper finds depending upon the theoretical arguments accepted at each stage of the model, the advocacy activities of an NGO may be considered to cause a widespread and often unintended negative impact upon the lives of many stakeholders who are either close to, or remote from, the NGO. Also, that depending upon the theoretical position taken regarding the scope of accountability, all entities – including NGOs – may be regarded as responsible and accountable for the impacts which their activities directly and indirectly cause to a broad range of stakeholders.
Research limitations/implications
The model is primarily theoretical, so it can benefit from empirical studies to assess its applicability in practice. It also has the scope to be applied in assessing the responsibility and accountability of a range of other entities for their advocacy – such as businesses, religious bodies, political parties, and academics.
Practical implications
The paper presents a ontribution to the growing debate on NGO accountability.
Originality/value
The paper uses the synthesis of various philosophical positions to develop a conditional, staged model which may be used to establish whether NGOs (and other organisations) can be regarded as having responsibilities and accountabilities for the direct and indirect impacts of their advocacy activities on a broad range of stakeholders.","middle section;“Stage 3: plausibility and likelihood of acceptance of linear predictive narratives ”;;

","Autism is the most common developmental disorder in the United States, with the number of diagnosed cases increasing secondary to more sensitive screening methods. Because autism has no known cause or accepted treatment approach, many parents and physicians have employed a number of dietary manipulations to alter the effects of the so-called leaky gut, which is believed by some to be the underlying cause of the regressive behaviors particular to autism. However, the link between autism and a gastrointestinal pathophysiology is not substantiated by research. The dietary approaches employed are cumbersome, not proven to be efficacious, and may further narrow the food choices of the child with autism.

Key findings Examination of the development of parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom shows that, although there is no formal separation of powers, there is a long established convention that legislation should be subject to detailed parliamentary scrutiny, should respect common law, and should be subject to judicial review. This convention has been overturned. Consequently, many recent laws conflict with long-established human rights. Some are unworkable or damaging or both. Public health professionals are being asked to implement poorly thought out laws, against a background of loss of trust. History warns of the danger that public health could be sucked into participation in repressive policies that override the rights of the individual in the apparent interests of the public good.
Conclusions There is a need for a rebalancing of power in the United Kingdom, both among the three branches of government (executive, legislature, and judiciary) and its constituent parts (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland). Constitutional reform is a long-term aim but for now much can be done to hold the executive to account and to be aware of the dangers faced by public health

","Background  The epidemiology of autism has been rather confusing, with very variable published prevalence figures and no clear incidence data. The cause of autism is unclear; vaccines have been incriminated.
Methods  Literature review and interpretation.
Results  The recorded prevalence of autism has increased considerably in recent years. This reflects greater recognition, with changes in diagnostic practice associated with more trained diagnosticians; broadening of diagnostic criteria to include a spectrum of disorder; a greater willingness by parents and educationalists to accept the label (in part because of entitlement to services); and better recording systems, among other factors. The cause(s) of autism remains unclear. There is a strong genetic component which, along with prenatally determined neuro‐anatomical/biochemical changes, makes any post‐natal ‘cause’ unlikely.
Conclusions  There has (probably) been no real increase in the incidence of autism. There is no scientific evidence that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine or the mercury preservative used in some vaccines plays any part in the aetiology or triggering of autism, even in a subgroup of children with the condition.

","Irritable bowel syndrome is a common disorder defined by a symptom complex including abdominal pain and altered bowel habit. The etiopathogenesis appears to be multifactorial and to involve altered gastrointestinal motor function, enhanced perception of visceral stimuli and psychosocial factors. More recently a role for mucosal immune activation has been suggested. Routine histologic examination reveals no mucosal abnormality in the majority of cases but quantitative histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses reveal subtle morphologic changes involving lymphocytes, mast cells, enterochromaffin cells and enteric nerves. The recent appreciation of these changes has led to new hypotheses linking central and enteric nervous systems to immune processes. This review highlights the spectrum of morphologic changes that occur in irritable bowel syndrome, examines their relationship to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome and considers their relevance to daily pathology practice.

The documented prevalence of all forms of autism has increased steadily during this time, suggesting one or more environmental contributors.

In 1998, Wakefield and colleagues reported an association between gastrointestinal inflammation and developmental regression in a group of 12 children.1 The onset of behavioural problems had been linked, by either the parents or the child's physician, with measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination.;;
Seven of the articles were from a single centre.1-7 We quickly identified serious problems, which were obvious only on detailed analysis of the papers themselves and by comparison between different papers from the same group. For this reason, discussion of these papers is rather detailed and we have chosen to present them individually since it was not possible to construct a coherent narrative in any other fashion.;;
These papers largely deal with flow cytometric analysis of cells isolated from the mucosa of autistic children and controls. In each, however, there is descriptive pathology which repeats previous studies1, 2 and which we will not re‐iterate. Of note, however, is the acknowledgement in each paper that the majority of children with autism in these studies had constipation, whereas the incidence of constipation in controls is not mentioned.;;
This most recent paper is a recapitulation of previous studies with a larger group of autistic children (including those reported in Refs 1, 2 and perhaps those reported in 3, 5, 6), to the extent of the almost identical reproduction of Table 1 from Ref. 2. Constipation as the main gut problem in autistic children is acknowledged (> 50%), but the controls contain only a few constipated children (4/30) and it is not made clear if the constipated controls belong to the group with histopathological abnormalities or to the group in which there was no reported pathology. ;;

Since this paper adds no new information and indeed represents the third report in the literature of the original 12 index cases,1 in the interests of brevity we will not discuss it further.;;
We can only speculate why severe constipation was not acknowledged as a significant gut symptom in the original paper1 and was revealed only in correspondence.8 Having accepted, however, that this was a major problem in these children, subsequent studies from this group should have explicitly included developmentally normal children with severe constipation as the appropriate control group.;;","discusses;;

","A series of studies in children with pervasive developmental disorder and gastrointestinal symptoms has reported the presence of a subtle mucosal inflammation, immunohistochemical abnormalities of structure and cellular infiltrate, pro‐inflammatory lymphocyte cytokine profiles, and functional intestinal abnormalities. MacDonald and Domizio question the existence of the mucosal lesion. In contrast, independent replication of the original findings has come from Europe, and North and South America; the data are presented. The willingness of the authors to attribute any mucosal changes to chronic constipation relies heavily on what appears to be a misinterpretation of data that is confounded by the association between cow's milk intolerance and constipation in children. A re‐challenge effect on intestinal symptoms and a biological gradient of mucosal inflammation is evident for an alternative environmental exposure in some children. Application of the research tools and methods that have been developed to examine the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease should be applied to the investigation of affected children in order to further advance our understanding and treatment of this lesion.

","Objective To explore parents’ understandings of the diseases included in the current UK Childhood Immunization Programme (CIP), and the role of first‐ and second‐hand experiences of these diseases in assessments of their severity.
Methods A qualitative study in which 66 parents (58 mothers and 8 fathers) of children aged 6 years and below, and six mothers of immuno‐compromised children, took part in 18 focus group discussions between November 2002 and March 2003.
Results There were many gaps in parents’ knowledge about some vaccine‐preventable diseases, most notably diphtheria, tetanus and haemophilus influenzae type b, three of the diseases covered by the pentavalent vaccine (introduced into the UK CIP in 2004). These gaps led some parents to question the need for vaccination. First‐hand experiences of the diseases reinforced the need for vaccination in some cases (e.g. Men C), but undermined it in others (e.g. pertussis, measles, rubella, mumps). Poliomyelitis and diphtheria were no longer seen as a threat to children’s health in Britain. Some parents saw mumps as only a threat to boys’ health and rubella as only having relevance to girls’.
Conclusions As fewer parents have direct experiences of vaccine‐preventable diseases, there is an increasing need to provide parents with accessible information about these diseases. It is also important to recognize that direct or indirect experiences of any of the diseases may either heighten or diminish parents’ assessments of the severity of these diseases.

","Background
Despite the Government acting quickly to reassure parents about MMR safety following the publication of the 1998 paper by Wakefield and colleagues, MMR uptake declined. One of the reasons suggested for this decline is a loss of public trust in politicians and health professionals. The purpose of this analysis was to examine parents' views on the role the media, politicians and health professionals have played in providing credible evidence about MMR safety.
Methods
A qualitative focus group study conducted with parents living in Central Scotland. Eighteen focus groups were conducted with 72 parents (64 mothers and 8 fathers) between November 2002 and March 2003. Purposive sampling was used to ensure maximum variation among parents.
Results
In the period after the MMR controversy, parents found it difficult to know who to trust to offer balanced and accurate information. The general consensus was that politicians were untrustworthy in matters of health. The motives of primary health care providers were suspected by some parents, who saw them as having a range of vested interests (including financial incentives). Among the sources of evidence seen by some parents as more credible were other parents, and Andrew Wakefield who was viewed as an important whistle-blower and champion of ordinary parents.
Conclusion
The provision of accurate information is only one aspect of helping parents make immunisation decisions. Establishing and maintaining trust in the information provided is also important. The MMR controversy may provide useful lessons for health professionals about trust and credibility that may be generalisable to future health controversies.

Medical record review indicated that 27 of 31 (87%) children had autism/ASD and 19 (61.3%) had evidence of developmental regression (loss of social, language, or motor skills). The proportion of VAERS cases of autism with regression was greater than that reported in population-based studies, based on the subset of VAERS cases with medical record confirmation. This difference may reflect preferential reporting to VAERS of autism with regression. In other respects, the children in this study appear to be similar to other children with autism.

During the late 1990s the triple measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was the subject of widespread concern vis-a-vis its possible link with bowel disorders and autism. The government resisted calls for policy change despite a decline in MMR uptake. Why did the government continue to support MMR? The article explores this question and advances a possible explanation of policy stability in the face of pressure for policy change. It draws on the advocacy coalition framework to examine the immunization policy process, analyse the role of expert advice and contrast the relative strength of the government's case with the relative weakness of those actors advocating policy change. While the advocacy coalition framework helps to frame the analysis, it is an imperfect fit for the case study. Instead of a policy subsystem of competing advocacy coalitions, the case reveals a dominant group of actors (likened to a policy fortress) presiding over immunization policy.

Currently, there are several new vaccines and adjuvants in the pipeline. Of these vaccines, many will be offered mainly to adolescents or adults.

","Autism is well known as a complex developmental disorder with a seemingly confusing and uncertain pathogenesis. The definitive mechanisms that promote autism are poorly understood and mostly unknown, yet available theories do appear to focus on the disruption of normal cerebral development and its subsequent implications on the functional brain unit. This mini-review aims solely to discuss and evaluate the most prominent current theories regarding the pathogenesis of autism. The main conclusion is that although there is not a clear pathway of mechanisms directed towards a simple pathogenesis and an established link to autism on the symptomatic level; there are however several important theories (neural connectivity, neural migration, excitatory-inhibitory neural activity, dendritic morphology, neuroimmune; calcium signalling and mirror neurone) which appear to offer an explanation to how autism develops. It seems probable that autism's neurodevelopmental defect is ‘multi-domain’ in origin (rather than a single anomaly) and is hence distributed across numerous levels of study (genetic, immunopathogenic, etc.). A more definitive understanding of the pathogenesis could facilitate the development of better treatments for this complex psychiatric disorder.

Exposure to the loss frame increased intentions to obtain the MMR vaccine and influenced perceptions of outcome efficacy.

","The debate on pediatric vaccination policy has been characterized by the presence of two distinct coalitions: those in favor of current vaccination policies and those expressing concern about these policies. The target of these coalitions is the vaccination decision of parents. To determine their influence, we conducted four focus groups in Toronto, Canada examining parental decision-making concerning pediatric vaccination. Our focus groups consisted of both fathers and mothers and parents who fully vaccinated and those who did not. Using the Advocacy Coalition Framework as an analytic guide, we identified several themes that provided insights into how effective the two coalitions have been in conveying their viewpoints. In general, we identified a variety of levels of belief systems existing amongst parents concerned about vaccination, some more amenable to change than others. We found that the choice to not vaccinate was largely a result of concerns about safety and, to a lesser extent, about lack of effectiveness. These parental views reflected the ability of the coalition concerned about vaccination to challenge parents' trust in traditional public health sources of information. In contrast, the parental decision to vaccinate was due to recognizing the importance of preventing disease and also a consequence of not questioning recommendations from public health and physicians and feeling pressured to because of school policies. Importantly, parents who fully vaccinate appear to have weaker belief systems that are potentially susceptible to change. While current policies appear to be effective in encouraging vaccination, if trust in public health falters, many who currently support vaccination may reevaluate their position. More research needs to be conducted to identify approaches to communicate the risks and benefits of vaccination to parents.

","Objective
To assess reasons for low uptake of immunization amongst orthodox Jewish families.

Design
Qualitative interviews with 25 orthodox Jewish mothers and 10 local health care workers.

Setting
The orthodox Jewish community in North East London.

Main outcome measures
Identification of views on immunization in the orthodox Jewish community.

Results
In a community assumed to be relatively insulated from direct media influence, word of mouth is nevertheless a potent source of rumours about vaccination dangers. The origins of these may lie in media scares that contribute to anxieties about MMR. At the same time, close community cohesion leads to a sense of relative safety in relation to tuberculosis, with consequent low rates of BCG uptake. Thus low uptake of different immunizations arises from enhanced feelings of both safety and danger. Low uptake was not found to be due to the practical difficulties associated with large families, or to perceived insensitive cultural practices of health care providers.

Conclusions
The views and practices of members of this community are not homogeneous and may change over time. It is important that assumptions concerning the role of religious beliefs do not act as an obstacle for providing clear messages concerning immunization, and community norms may be challenged by explicitly using its social networks to communicate more positive messages about immunization. The study provides a useful example of how social networks may reinforce or challenge misinformation about health and risk and the complex nature of decision making about children's health.

","Objective: This study investigated the immunisation knowledge, attitudes and practices among health professionals in two regional Area Health Services of NSW with low and high immunisation rates. It also compared these factors between the areas and between the health professional groups.
Methods: A self‐administered questionnaire was posted in 2006 to health professionals, located within the North Coast and Hunter New England Area Health Services, whose practice could include immunisation. This included general practitioners (GPs), practice nurses, community nurses, hospital nurses and midwives.
Results: Out of 926 surveys sent, 434 were returned (47%). The great majority of the health professionals (97%) believed that vaccines were safe, effective and necessary. However, in approximately one‐third of respondents, there were specific concerns about additives, immune system overload and the number of vaccines. Significantly more health professionals in the North Coast area believed that additives in vaccines may be harmful and that adding more vaccines to the schedule would make immunisation too complex. Among GPs, over half felt uncomfortable about giving more than two injections at the one visit.
Conclusions: Health professionals in this study had overall confidence in vaccines but had specific concerns about the number of vaccines given to children and vaccine content. These unfounded concerns may reduce parental confidence in immunisation.
Implications: There is value in governments and immunisation support workers continuing their efforts to maintain up‐to‐date knowledge among health professionals and support the delivery of appropriate and targeted information to address concerns about vaccines.

In the study, published in the Lancet, gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield and 12 colleagues described a self-selected sample of 12 children referred to the Royal Free Hospital in London (Wakefield et al., 1998). All had been diagnosed with autism prior to enrollment in the study. ;;
In the immediate aftermath of the Wakefield et al. (1998) article, the media were faced with an important challenge: to report on an issue with crucial health policy implications, even though the scientific debate sur- rounding an autism-vaccine link was (at that point in time) ongoing. In doing so, the media was in effect “creating science” in lieu of a scientific consensus emerging (Lewenstein, 1995). ;;
Studies or claims were coded as “pro-link” if they indicated that a link was possible, plausible, or probable. This variable included, for example, mention of the Wakefield et al. (1998) article in the Lancet. Wakefield himself was often very vocal in his support for a potential autism-vaccine association; British newspaper accounts declared that he “stood by” his research findings (Day, 2004). ;;
In another sense, the cause was also external to the AVC. Gregory and Miller (1998), for example, argued that media scholars should consider the larger social context in which news stories emerge. At the time of the Wakefield et al. article in 1998, Mad Cow Disease (also known as BSE) was the subject of considerable policy debate, as the British government struggled to understand the full scope of the threat, and the British public grew distrustful of government reassurances that beef was safe to consume. Indeed, as Hargreaves et al. (2003, p. 40) noted, the AVC “is often com- pared to the [BSE] crisis, [with] both stories involving potential risks to the public initially denied by both government and mainstream science.” ;;
Scholars will need to consider a number of factors in attempting to iso- late any effects (however large or small) of frames on public perceptions of or attitude towards the AVC. First, given the long duration of the AVC (over 10 years if one uses the Wakefield et al. 1998 article as a reference point), studying public attitudes over time may prove far more rewarding that an analysis done only once at a particular point in time. Second, researchers will need to decide how best to define the impacts of frames.;;","describes;;

","Background
The presence of measles virus (MV) RNA in bowel tissue from children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances was reported in 1998. Subsequent investigations found no associations between MV exposure and ASD but did not test for the presence of MV RNA in bowel or focus on children with ASD and GI disturbances. Failure to replicate the original study design may contribute to continued public concern with respect to the safety of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.
Methodology/Principal Findings
The objective of this case-control study was to determine whether children with GI disturbances and autism are more likely than children with GI disturbances alone to have MV RNA and/or inflammation in bowel tissues and if autism and/or GI episode onset relate temporally to receipt of MMR. The sample was an age-matched group of US children undergoing clinically-indicated ileocolonoscopy. Ileal and cecal tissues from 25 children with autism and GI disturbances and 13 children with GI disturbances alone (controls) were evaluated by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for presence of MV RNA in three laboratories blinded to diagnosis, including one wherein the original findings suggesting a link between MV and ASD were reported. The temporal order of onset of GI episodes and autism relative to timing of MMR administration was examined. We found no differences between case and control groups in the presence of MV RNA in ileum and cecum. Results were consistent across the three laboratory sites. GI symptom and autism onset were unrelated to MMR timing. Eighty-eight percent of ASD cases had behavioral regression.
Conclusions/Significance
This study provides strong evidence against association of autism with persistent MV RNA in the GI tract or MMR exposure. Autism with GI disturbances is associated with elevated rates of regression in language or other skills and may represent an endophenotype distinct from other ASD.","introduction;;

However, an expectation that this will improve the quality of policy produced and provide a path to increased involvement of nurses in the policy process is misplaced. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that the emphasis on evidence-based policy is problematic and cannot be regarded as a “new model” of policy making. Also, it could deflect attention from more practical approaches to policy involvement on the part of nurses. Policy development activities, acquisition of skills in policy analysis, and other forms of involvement are needed if nurses are to move along the continuum from policy literacy, through policy acumen, to policy competence.

Final section;“Conclusions”; Conclusion;;","The MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine scare has been one of the major health issues in the United Kingdom over the last decade. The publication of research which cast doubt on the safety of the MMR vaccine in 1998 [1] led to widespread media reporting and falling MMR vaccine rates alongside outbreaks of measles which were attributed to those falling vaccine rates. The media coverage received by the MMR vaccine peaked in early 2002. ;;
This is interesting, in light of the mostly negative coverage that the MMR vaccine received in the articles analysed. 
In the wider context of the vaccine scare, content on the alleged link between the MMR vaccine and autism/bowel disorders which was proposed by Wakefield et al. [1] was examined. A greater number of articles mentioned the link between the MMR vaccine and autism (n = 68) and the link between the MMR vaccine and bowel disorders (n = 52) than refuted the link (autism = 28, bowel disorders = 21).;;
This also reflects the nature of the reporting of the MMR vaccine scare, in that articles which mentioned the link between the MMR vaccine and autism/bowel disorders stated that the link was ‘alleged’ but did not go into detail to refute the link. The research of Wakefield et al. [1] was mentioned in 31 articles, but 17 of these mentioned the limitations of the research. 
Articles included content that recommended single vaccinations against measles, mumps and rubella (n = 48) and reported on the increased demand for single vaccinations (n = 52). ;;
Table 3 provides details of the results of the χ2 tests to determine whether there was an association between whether individuals were mentioned or not and whether specific issues were included in the article contents or not. 
There were highly significant associations between the mention of Andrew Wakefield in articles and the article contents, including the mention of autism and bowel disorders and the MMR vaccine, i.e. addressing the links which Wakefield et al. [1] had proposed existed between the MMR vaccine and autism/bowel disease. Of the 32 articles in which Andrew Wakefield was mentioned, 24 (75%) mentioned that autism was related to the MMR vaccine, compared with the 136 articles that did not mention Andrew Wakefield, of which 44 (32.4%) mentioned that autism was related to the MMR vaccine.;;
The MMR vaccine scare was characterized in the mass media as a two-sided debate about the safety of the vaccine. The anti MMR vaccine lobby based its argument on the research of Wakefield et al. [1] and supported this by anecdotal evidence of children alleged to be damaged by the MMR vaccine. As this research was the trigger for the MMR vaccine scare, the pro MMR vaccine lobby had to address two issues: refuting the evidence of Wakefield et al. [1] that the MMR vaccine poses a risk to children, and promoting the MMR vaccine as an important way to deal with the diseases of measles, mumps and rubella. Both ‘sides’ of the MMR vaccine debate were presented in the media as having com- pelling arguments. ;;

[16] found that the burden of proof was placed on those who supported the MMR vaccine to prove that it was safe. ;;
The media reporting was characterized by specific events/episodes that led to increased coverage relating to the MMR vaccine. The initial media reporting about the MMR vaccine originated from the initial article by Wakefield et al. [1] and, at the time of the publication of the articles that were examined in this study, measles outbreaks were occurring, and the refusal of Tony Blair to reveal the MMR vaccination status of his son was receiving substantial coverage in the media. The content analysis has highlighted the reporting relating to the MMR vaccine as a health scare as defined by Klaidman [17] and Ward [18]. ;;

","The mass media provides a frame for discourse around important health issues, and it has been widely demonstrated that the development and reinforcement of stereotypes of minority groups are strongly influenced by the news and entertainment media.

Key findings include a relatively limited amount of factual information and a dual stereotype of people labeled as having autism as either dangerous and uncontrollable or unloved and poorly treated.

","In the last two decades, culture has emerged in population health as a common explanation for health outcomes and disparities. This paper systematically reviews such cultural accounts, focusing on a historical sample of articles from prominent population health journals (1930–2008, n=100) and a contemporary sample of articles in the American Journal of Public Health (2008, n=95). The review reveals that references to culture rarely (1) specify the precise pathways by which culture influences health or (2) assess the plausibility of these pathways. Despite these weaknesses, a few studies have begun to clarify, measure, and assess how culture can influence health outcomes, and these articles reflect promising new avenues for understanding how cultural factors influence variation in health and well-being.

Attempts to portray the anti-vaccination chiropractors as unscientific extremists, by both orthodox medicine and from within the chiropractic community itself, clouds the informed consent and freedom of choice aspect relating to health care that they espouse, and scapegoats the so-called extremists rather than facing the ethical issues surrounding fully informed consent.

","Social and behavioral science research is integral to the conduct of HIV vaccine trials, especially because the vaccine targets an infection laden with sensitive human issues. Although social and behavioral sciences have played a larger role in HIV vaccine clinical trials than other vaccine clinical trials to date, this role should be expanded. Fortunately, related publications, conference coverage and research proposals are on the rise; community engagement is receiving more attention during the earlier stages of product development; and collaboration between HIV vaccine scientists and social and behavioral scientists is being fostered. Greater attention to social and behavioral science issues could not only facilitate accrual, but also improve research efficiency and relevance. In this review, gaps in the literature on social and behavioral science issues in HIV vaccine clinical research, including barriers and facilitators to trial participation, enhancing feasibility of trial success, health systems, policy and monitoring social and behavioral issues, are identified and directions are suggested for filling those gaps.

","Although child vaccination rates remain high, some parental concern persists that vaccines might cause autism. Three specific hypotheses have been proposed: (1) the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine causes autism by damaging the intestinal lining, which allows the entrance of encephalopathic proteins; (2) thimerosal, an ethylmercury-containing preservative in some vaccines, is toxic to the central nervous system; and (3) the simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines overwhelms or weakens the immune system. We will discuss the genesis of each of these theories and review the relevant epidemiological evidence.

All 8 of these children had gastrointestinal symptoms and signs and lymphoid nodular hyperplasia revealed on endoscopy.;;
From these observations, Wakefield postulated that MMR vaccine caused intestinal inflammation that led to translocation of usually nonpermeable peptides to the bloodstream and, subsequently, to the brain, where they affected development.
Several issues undermine the interpretation by Wakefield et al. [1] of this case series. First, the self-referred cohort did not include control subjects, which precluded the authors from determining whether the occurrence of autism following receipt of MMR vaccine was causal or coincidental.;;
The results were unchanged when both exposure and outcome definitions varied, including a strict diagnosis of autism.
Additional population-based studies considered the relationship between MMR vaccine and the “new variant” form of autism proposed by Wakefield et al. [1]—specifically, developmental regression with gastrointestinal symptoms. Although it is difficult to analyze such a phenomenon when it is unclear that one exists (which complicates the formulation of a case definition), conclusions may be gleaned from the data with respect to developmental regression alone (i.e., autism irrespective of coincident bowel problems).;;","describes;;

","‘Anecdotal evidence’’ has become a central point of contention in two recent controversies over science and technology (We follow Nelkin (1992, 10) in referring to our cases as controversies over science and technology.) in the United Kingdom and a contact point between individuals, expert institutions, and policy decisions. We argue that the term is central to the management of the boundary between experts and nonexperts, with consequences for ideas of public engagement and participation. This article reports on two separate pieces of qualitative social research into recent UK public risk controversies with the aim of unfolding the processes by which anecdotal evidence comes to be defined. We do not define anecdotal evidence as an epistemic category that exists prior to the public controversies themselves; rather, we aim to show how the term is constructed and contested by expert and nonexpert actors. We find that anecdotal evidence comes to be accepted (albeit in different ways) by the main actors as an epistemic category, yet that it is multidimensional, open to interpretation as subjective reports, as an indicator of expert ignorance, as a source of novel hypotheses and as a set of political claims for recognition and inclusion. We conclude that the flexibility of anecdotal evidence at the boundary between science and its publics can offer opportunities for participation and engagement, as well as exclusion and alienation.

","Background
Health visitors play a pivotal position in providing parents with up-to-date evidence-based care on child health. The recent controversy over the safety of the MMR vaccine has drawn attention to the difficulties they face when new research which raises doubts about current guidelines and practices is published. In the aftermath of the MMR controversy, this paper investigates the sources health visitors use to find out about new research evidence on immunisation and examines barriers and facilitators to using evidence in practice. It also assesses health visitors' confidence in using research evidence.
Methods
Health visitors were recruited from the 2007 UK Community Practitioners' and Health Visitors' Association conference. All delegates were eligible to complete the questionnaire if in their current professional role they advise parents about childhood immunisation or administer vaccines to children. Of 228 who were eligible, 185 completed the survey (81.1%).
Results
These health visitors used a wide range of resources to find out about new research evidence on childhood immunisation. Popular sources included information leaflets and publications, training days, nursing journals and networking with colleagues. A lack of time was cited as the main barrier to searching for new evidence. The most common reason given for not using research in practice was a perception of conflicting research evidence. Understanding the evidence was a key facilitator. Health visitors expressed less confidence about searching and explaining research on childhood immunisation than evidence on weaning and a baby's sleep position.
Conclusion
Even motivated health visitors feel they lack the time and, in some cases, the skills to locate and appraise research evidence. This research suggests that of the provision of already-appraised research would help to keep busy health professionals informed, up-to-date and confident in responding to public concerns, particularly when there is apparently conflicting evidence. Health visitors' relative lack of confidence about research on immunisation suggests there is still a job to be done in rebuilding confidence in evidence on childhood immunisation. Further research on what makes evidence more comprehensible, convincing and useable would contribute to understanding how to bridge the gulf between evidence and practice.
",Background;;,"Despite a substantial body of evidence supporting vaccine safety, recent studies have consistently reported that health visitors are poorly informed about the contraindications and adverse effects of vaccines [3–6]. The recent debate over the safety of the MMR vaccine following the publication in 1998 of a paper which was interpreted as suggesting a putative link with autism [7] highlighted a lack of knowledge and confidence in the MMR vaccine among practitioners, including health visitors. Although parents' satisfaction with health visitors with respect to immunisation visits is generally high [8], during the MMR debate some parents reported a lack of trust and confidence in information and advice offered by health professionals [9].;;",disputes;;,neutral;;,no;;,

","Background
The paradigm of translational medicine that underpins frameworks such as the Cooksey report on the funding of health research does not adequately reflect the complex reality of the public health environment. We therefore outline a translational framework for public health research.
Discussion
Our framework redefines the objective of translation from that of institutionalising effective interventions to that of improving population health by influencing both individual and collective determinants of health. It incorporates epidemiological perspectives with those of the social sciences, recognising that many types of research may contribute to the shaping of policy, practice and future research. It also identifies a pivotal role for evidence synthesis and the importance of non-linear and intersectoral interfaces with the public realm.
Summary
We propose a research agenda to advance the field and argue that resources for 'applied' or 'translational' public health research should be deployed across the framework, not reserved for 'dissemination' or 'implementation'.

At the same time, it acknowledges that isolated research findings or even 'factoids' (assertions repeated so frequently that they are assumed to be true) influence policy and practice, whether helpfully or unhelpfully (Table 5) [37–40]. This reflects an unresolved tension between the apparently uncontentious principle that the findings of single research studies should be disseminated to groups of key policymakers and practitioners and an alternative view that it may be inappropriate or even harmful to do so without placing those findings in the context of all other available findings on the same question [39, 41, 42] – a view reflected in the CONSORT statement on the reporting of randomised controlled trials [43].;;",ridicules;;,negative;;,no;;,

","Background: Drug liabilities become more frequent, more publicized, and more costly. They impact patients' perception, physicians' practice, clinical research, and medical communication.
Purpose: To familiarize physicians with products liabilities. Data sources and extraction: Product liabilities ongoing at the 12 largest drug manufacturers are reviewed. The 2005 company reports are source documents. Medical events triggering liabilities are further reviewed. Websites of companies and health authorities are explored, and a Google search is performed. A PubMed search since the year each liability started is done. Data synthesis: Liabilities are frequent, 4.3 per company, and predominate in the United States. Multiple safety events of varying severity and frequency led individuals to claim physical damages. Plaintiffs always allege the company failed to inform users properly about drug risk. Liabilities spread across therapeutic classes. The risk increases when the label is changed or a drug is withdrawn. Publications reporting new data are frequent triggers. Company costs ranged from US$62 million to US$21 billion.
Trends indicate an increase in liabilities and associated costs. New plaintiffs are third-party payers and company shareholders. Liabilities spread outside the United States and may include lack of efficacy claims. Insurers now consider the risk of liabilities too high to continue manufacturers' coverage. Conclusions: Product liabilities impact health care. The registration of clinical studies and the posting of their results will bring more transparency to medical research and communication. This could counterbalance current liabilities trends. The future will establish whether drug liabilities are inversely proportional to the ability to be transparent with data and promptly adjust risks and benefits.

","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a behaviourally defined syndrome where the etiology and pathophysiology is only partially understood. In a small proportion of children with the condition, a specific medical disorder is identified, but the causal significance in many instances is unclear. Currently, the medical conditions that are best established as probable causes of ASD include Fragile X syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis and abnormalities of chromosome 15 involving the 15q11-13 region. Various other single gene mutations, genetic syndromes, chromosomal abnormalities and rare de novo copy number variants have been reported as being possibly implicated in etiology, as have several ante and post natal exposures and complications. However, in most instances the evidence base for an association with ASD is very limited and largely derives from case reports or findings from small, highly selected and uncontrolled case series. Not only therefore, is there uncertainty over whether the condition is associated, but the potential basis for the association is very poorly understood. In some cases the medical condition may be a consequence of autism or simply represent an associated feature deriving from an underlying shared etiology. Nevertheless, it is clear that in a growing proportion of individuals potentially causal medical conditions are being identified and clarification of their role in etio-pathogenesis is necessary. Indeed, investigations into the causal mechanisms underlying the association between conditions such as tuberous sclerosis, Fragile X and chromosome 15 abnormalities are beginning to cast light on the molecular and neurobiological pathways involved in the pathophysiology of ASD. It is evident therefore, that much can be learnt from the study of probably causal medical disorders as they represent simpler and more tractable model systems in which to investigate causal mechanisms. Recent advances in genetics, molecular and systems biology and neuroscience now mean that there are unparalleled opportunities to test causal hypotheses and gain fundamental insights into the nature of autism and its development.

","Vaccines have contributed enormously in reducing the impact of many infectious diseases, and the expanded use of new and existing vaccines provides unprecedented potential for further reducing the global burden of infectious diseases. Yet, as with the deployment of other technologies, their use may also sometimes be associated with undesirable effects that need to be identified rapidly, understood and minimized. In this article, we review the models and systems that have been developed to monitor and respond to concerns regarding vaccine safety and we give illustrative examples of real or perceived vaccine safety issues. The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) was set up 10 years ago and charged to provide the WHO with independent advice on vaccine safety issues. The role of the GACVS is both to analyze and to interpret reports of the adverse effects of vaccines that impact on global vaccination programs and strategies, and to foster the development of improved surveillance systems to detect any adverse effects of vaccines, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. It also monitors the development of new vaccines during clinical testing and advises on the safe use of vaccines in immunization programs. As success is achieved with reducing the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, there will be increasing attention focused on potential adverse effects, on the development of effective surveillance systems to detect adverse effects, and on improved methods to manage and control any harmful consequences of vaccination.

There was no significant difference between the autism group and children in the special schools except for faddiness, which is an autism specific symptom and not a bowel symptom.

The publication in 1998 of research carried out by several medical practitioners working at the Royal Free Hospital in London (Wakefield et al, 1998) led many people to question the safety of the MMR vaccine and of vaccinations in general; subsequently uptake dropped substancially to around 80% by 2004 (HPA, 2008a). 
The past 6 years have shown no substantial increase in MMR uptake as it continues to have the lowest uptake of any vaccine in the childhood immunization schedule (NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care, 2008) , and this has led both the DH and the HPA to issue warning of the potential for measles and mumps epidemics among children and adolescents in the UK. ;;
In 1998, the Lancet published an article from research led by Dr Andrew Wakefield (Wakefield et al, 1998), then a respected bowel surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital in London. The study, written by a total of 13 medical practitioners working at the Royal Free Hospital, explored a possible link between autistic regression and irritable bowel disorder in young children and suggested that the MMR vaccine could trigger a bowel inflammation. ;;","credits;;

","Increased prevalence of the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and the failure to find genetic explanations has pushed the hunt for environmental causes. These disorders are defined clinically but lack objective characterization. To meet this need, we measured neurobehavioral and pulmonary functions in eight ASD boys aged 8 to 19 years diagnosed clinically and compared them to 145 unaffected children from a community with no known chemical exposures. As 6 of 35 consecutive mold/mycotoxin (mold)-exposed children aged 5 to 13 years had ASD, we compared them to the 29 non-ASD mold-exposed children, and to the eight ASD boys. Comparisons were adjusted for age, height, weight, and grade attained in school. The eight ASD boys averaged 6.8 abnormalities compared to 1.0 in community control boys. The six mold-exposed ASD children averaged 12.2 abnormalities. The most frequent abnormality in both groups was balance, followed by visual field quadrants, and then prolonged blink reflex latency. Neuropsychological abnormalities were more frequent in mold-exposed than in terbutaline-exposed children and included digit symbol substitution, peg placement, fingertip number writing errors, and picture completion. Profile of mood status scores averaged 26.8 in terbutaline-exposed, 52 in mold exposed, and 26 in unexposed.

","The increasing complexity of scientific research has been followed by increasing varieties of research misconduct. Dealing with misconduct involves the processes of detection, reporting, and investigation of misconduct. Each of these steps is associated with numerous problems which need to be addressed. Misconduct investigation should not stop with inquiries and disciplinary actions in specific episodes of misconduct. It is necessary to decrease the personal price paid by those who expose misconduct and to protect the personal and professional interests of honest researchers accused of misconduct unfairly or mistakenly.

","Aim
This study explored health visitors’ perception of their role in the universal childhood immunisation programme with particular emphasis on influencing factors and communication strategies.
Background
The majority of parents’ consent to immunisation, but some find decision-making in this area difficult and have unmet information needs. In the United Kingdom, health visitors routinely provide immunisation information for parents, whereas general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses tend to administer vaccines and respond to parents/carers’ questions. Research has investigated health professionals’ views and knowledge about immunisation, but less is understood about health visitors’ role and how they communicate with parents.
Method
Following the Local Research Ethics and Research Governance permissions, all health visitors (n = 120) working in one county in the United Kingdom were invited to participate in the study. Semistructured interviews (n = 22) were undertaken using a prompt guide. The interviews were transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis using an iterative approach was used to explore the data facilitated by NVIVO™ software.
Findings
Five themes emerged from the interviews. These were health visitors’ professional role; identity and perceived barriers and communication strategies, parents’ right to choose, confidence in measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination and communicating with migrant families about immunisation. There were differences between the health visitors in their perceptions of their roles, skills and knowledge and communication strategies. Health visitors perceived that GPs and practice nurses took a paternalistic approach to the provision of immunisation information, while they used a parental decision-making model. Health visitors reported a loss of professional confidence following the MMR crisis.
Conclusion
Given the evidence that some parents find it difficult to gain the information they need about immunisation and health visitors’ acknowledgement that their usual communication models were not effective during the MMR crisis, we feel specific communication skills training is needed to enable health professionals to provide parents with appropriate decision support.

","Aim
This study was designed to determine if there is a relationship between celiac disease (CD) and the presence of gastrointestinal disease (GI) disease in children with autism.

Subjects and Methods
One hundred twenty-two children were tested for IgG and IgA anti-transglutaminase autoantibodies (55 autistic children with GI disease, 28 non autistic children with no GI disease, 30 autistic children with no GI disease, and 9 non autistic children with GI Disease). We also compared the presence/level of these autoantibodies to presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and level of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT).

Results
We did not find a significant difference in the level of anti-transglutaminase IgG or IgA in autistic children with GI disease compared to controls. However, we found a significant relationship between the presence of ANCA and low-level IgG anti-transglutaminase IgG in children with autism and GI disease.

Discussion
Although there appears to be no relationship between these celiac disease markers and the presence of GI disease in autistic children, these results suggest a possible association between sub diagnostic levels of anti-transglutaminase IgG and the presence of ANCA, and therefore, supports the hypothesis that there is a generalized autoimmune dysfunction in autistic children with GI disease.

Middle section; “SCIENTIFIC AGENCY AND PARENT-EXPERTS ”;;","In the United States in particular, the focus was on thimerosal in vaccines as the major culprit for advocacy groups and parents in suggesting a causal link between exposure to vaccines and the outcome of autism in their children, when symptoms of autism generally are identified and vaccinations administered at approximately the same time period (Baker, 2008; Doja & Roberts, 2006; Geier, King, Sykes, & Geier, 2008; Katz, 2006; Normand & Dallery, 2007; Offit & Moser, 2009; Shevell & Fombonne, 2006). In confluence with the implementation of more extensive vaccination regimens of young children beginning in the early 1990s (Bernard et al., 2001; Fombonne, 2008; Stehr-Green et al., 2003), medical evidence positing a link between vaccines and ASD (e.g., Wakefield et al., 1998), and a similar time frame for vaccine administration and onset of ASD symptoms, and increased prevalence trends of ASD diagnoses puts forth, on the surface, a dramatic case that vaccines cause autism (Baker, 2008). The rhetorical use of co-occurring statistical trends and co-occurring phenomena to suggest causality is an effective way of making a claim to a wider lay public (Best, 2004; Normand & Dallery, 2007). ;;
These social conditions set the platform for the debate about the increased prevalence of childhood ASD diagnoses by consequently framing the issue in such a way as to direct attention to the more medically oriented possible causes (Baker, 2008; Furedi, 2006), subsequently legitimizing these state- ments, rather than looking to social influences such as changing measure- ments and ideas about childhood ASD (though these are often used as counter-arguments to the vaccine-induced hypotheses). Coinciding with the widespread media attention at the time to the Wakefield et al. (1998) study, considered a key catalyst of the vaccine-critical ASD movement (Baker, 2008; Begley, 2009; Kirby, 2005), focus was placed on environmental toxins and medical interventions in childhood that can affect neurological development and functioning (Matson & Minshawi, 2006). As such, the issue was framed from a medicalized perspective, one of disorder (and not simply difference), which also impacted how the issue was rhetorically presented by eager claimsmakers and subsequently dealt with (Baker, 2008; Best, 1987, 2008b; Hilgartner & Bosk, 1988; Molloy & Vasil, 2002; Poulson, 2009). ;;
If a treatment or strategy passes muster, it is formally presented at a think tank and then at a general conference. (Edelson, 2007) 
Investigation into the epidemiological breadth of childhood ASD, such as the California-based study described earlier, was prompted largely by the reaction of parents (whose children had ASD) to the Wakefield et al. (1998) study suggesting a link between vaccines and autism (Baker, 2008; Shevell & Fombonne, 2006) and the recommendation of the United States Public Health Service and the American Academy of Pediatrics in July 1999 to remove thimerosal from infant vaccines as a precautionary measure, even though there was no compelling evidence of its harm (DeStefano, 2009). Additionally, though the Wakefield et al. (1998) study was soon after critically challenged and has involved claims of fraud and ethical violations (Begley, 2009; Offit, 2008), the influence of the popular media presenting the alarming prevalence trend statistics and scientific results suggesting the possibility of serious harm being induced to children via vaccines prompted more political, educational, legal, and social movements in a variety of ways involving parents. ;;

","Objective: The objective of this feasibility study was to evaluate the acceptability and potential effectiveness of a web-based MMR decision aid in supporting informed decision-making for the MMR vaccine.
Design: This was a prospective before-and-after evaluation.
Setting: Thirty parents of children eligible for MMR vaccination were recruited from two childcare organizations in a moderately deprived community in a city in the north of England.
Method: Parents completed postal questionnaires at recruitment, one week and three months after using the decision aid. Data on the acceptability of the decision aid, informed decision-making outcome measures and vaccine uptake were collected. Telephone interviews were conducted with five parents. Acceptability data were analysed using simple descriptive statistics. Repeated measures ANOVAs were undertaken for analysing the informed decision-making data. Content analysis of the qualitative data was undertaken.
Results: Twenty six parents (87 per cent) completed all three study questionnaires. The decision aid was found to be acceptable to parents and was considered useful in supporting their informed decision-making. There was a statistically significant increase in parents’ knowledge over time and statistically significant decrease in decisional conflict for the MMR decision. Most parents (88 per cent) reported vaccinating their child.
Conclusions: We cannot extrapolate from our data to infer that the decision aid has changed decision-making outcomes or influenced vaccination uptake. However, findings suggest that it may increase knowledge about MMR and reduce decisional conflict to a level where parents can make an informed decision. A randomized controlled trial is now underway to expand on these findings.

In particular, can holding health officials accountable for their actions potentially “crowd out” mobilizing information?

","The success of vaccination programs is an uncontroversial reality – in Europe as well as worldwide. On the other hand, the perceived risk of adverse events in the general public is the most important threat for implementing successful vaccination programs in Europe. For this reason, monitoring and assessing vaccine safety is a priority for public health. Vaccine safety is assessed both before and after vaccine authorization. In postmarketing settings, different activities related to vaccine safety usually involve several different stakeholders. In 2005, a new EU agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, was established with the aim to strengthen Europe’s defences against infectious diseases. Implementing stable links between different stakeholders and defining clear roles in the EU is paramount in order to provide optimal and transparent information on adverse reactions following immunization, with the final goal of increasing compliance to safe and effective vaccination programs.

","Objective: To review the most common neurological disorders associated with various vaccines, and offer suggestions aiming at a better understanding if a causal relationship between the neurological complications and the vaccination is feasible.
Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed using combination of the following items: vaccines, vaccination, immunization and neurological complications. Review of reports and publications from the World Health Organizations, US Centers for Disease Control and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System regarding safety and common neurological complications following vaccinations. Especial attention was given to the incidence of complications in various Latin American countries.
Results: Neurological complications following vaccination are rare, and in most cases, represent a monophasic neurological event with good clinical recovery. However, serious and fatal complications have been reported. In general, neurological adverse events may not be causally related to the vaccine, and occur at much lower rates than same events following natural disease.
Discussion: Recent climatic changes and frequent international travel have changed the epidemiological spectrum of some infectious diseases. In view of the rapidly growing number of vaccines available and the need to implement massive immunization campaigns in several regions of the world, it is imperative to understand the potential adverse reactions of vaccinations. Neurological disorders are among the most serious, and on rare occasions, life-threatening complications after vaccination.

More recently, a possible association of austism with measles vaccination, multiple sclerosis with recombinant hepa- titis B vaccination and Guillain–Barre syndrome after influenza vaccination has been suggested4–6.

","This paper explores the role of social movements in the policy process and, in particular, the ways in which movements interact with, access, and deploy expert knowledge. In the technocratic model, citizens are conceptualized as undifferentiated, rather than considered in terms of distinctive identities or interests. Their inclusion in policy-making is viewed as a technical problem to be ‘solved’ through forms of citizen engagement, rather than viewing citizens as active agents in the mobilization of distinctive knowledges. Citizens, we argue, are more than the undifferentiated lump that appears in the technocratic model under the guise of citizen engagement. Drawing on a case study of autism activism in Canada and the US, we demonstrate the range of ways in which civil society actors both deploy and contest expert knowledge in the policy process, and discuss the implications for how we conceptualize knowledge mobilization in policy processes.

","The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders is believed to be higher than that of other conditions, such as Down syndrome or diabetes, yet few studies have explored the ideas lay people have about autism. Semi‐structured interviews were used to explore how 10 lay people with no knowledge or experience of autism conceptualised autism. Interpretative phenomenological analysis and discourse analysis illuminated four discourses: (1) autism as transgressing normative expectancies; (2) dependency and functional ability discourse; (3) autism and the discourse of mental status; (4) autism and explanatory discourses. Participants demonstrated clear views (although not necessarily correct) about the nature, origins and manifestations of autism. They drew upon their understanding of normal child development to make these assessments and they made judgements about the ability of individuals with autism to attain social independence. It is recommended that interactions between lay people and people with autism may help develop positive conceptualisations of autism.

The analysis shows that participants perceived people with autism to behave in ways that contravened societal and developmental norms, that they had increased dependency on others, that the autism was confining, that it was a condition like mental retardation or learning disability and that it was caused by internal and external factors. ;;",credits;;,neutral;;,no;;,

","As a result of the vaccines discovered in the 20th Century, parents and many healthcare providers of the 21st Century have limited or no experience with the devastating effects of diseases such as polio, smallpox or measles. Fear of disease has shifted to concerns regarding vaccine safety. Scientific evidence has refuted many of the misconceptions regarding vaccine safety; however, parental refusal of vaccines is increasing. Here we review six of the most prevalent controversies surrounding vaccine safety: the proposed causal relationship between receipt of the measles–mumps–rubella vaccine and autism; thimerosal as a potential trigger for autism; religious objection based on some vaccine viruses being grown in cell lines from aborted fetal tissues; parental worries that use of the human papillomavirus vaccine may lead to youth promiscuity; fears regarding the purported association between pertussis vaccination and adverse neurological outcomes; and concerns regarding too many vaccines overloading or weakening the infant immune system. Healthcare providers are ideally positioned to correct these misconceptions, but they must recognize and acknowledge parents’ concerns, educate themselves on the latest scientific research that addresses these, and dedicate sufficient time to discuss vaccine safety with worried parents.

","In 1998, the English physician Andrew Wakefield suggested that the MMR vaccine insults the guts of children who then regress developmentally and become autistic. Although his research did not provide firm evidence for this hypothesis, many believe that (a) the MMR vaccine can cause autism; (b) children with autism typically have gastrointestinal problems; and, (c) a necessary component of treating autism is “treating the gut” through dietary restrictions.

relationship (or lack thereof) between autism and the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Andrew Wakefield first suggested that the MMR vaccine could produce severe bowel problems and regression in development that manifests as autism (Wakefield et al., 1998). With his colleagues at the Royal Free Hospital, he studied 12 children with inflammation in their intestines. ;;
In a study published in the British medical journal the Lancet, Andrew Wakefield and colleagues stated that regressive autism and severe bowel problems might be associated with the MMR vaccine (Wakefield et al., 1998). This study suggested that a component of the measles virus from the vaccine was found in the guts of their participants and was the cause of gastrointestinal problems that led to regression. ;;
He has held press conferences since then to present unpublished research to bolster his claims and to assert that the United Kingdom released the MMR vaccine without proper testing. 
In July of 2007, Britain’s General Medical Council (GMC) launched an investigation into the fitness of Andrew Wakefield and two of his collaborators to practice medicine, stemming from their autistic regression study (Wakefield et al., 1998).

","Background: This article provides a review of the literature on beliefs that parents of children with autism hold, with a focus on their beliefs on the cause and course of the disorder. Research on the outcomes of their beliefs also was reviewed.
Methods: Medline, PsychInfo, Nursing@Ovid and PubMed were searched from 1995 through 2009 using the keywords autism, autistic disorder, beliefs, culture, parents, attitudes, and perceptions. Additional articles were identified through Google Scholar and from references in related articles. Thirteen articles were retrieved and reviewed.
Results: It was found in the review that parents hold a wide variety of beliefs about the cause of their child's autism, including genetic factors, events surrounding the child's birth, and environmental influences in the early childhood period. Some parents continue to attribute their child's autism to immunizations, although more recent studies suggest the frequency may be decreasing. Some parents are pessimistic about their child's future while others are hopeful that new strategies will be developed. Some trust that society will become more accepting of their child's idiosyncrasies. Parents' beliefs about the cause of their child's autism have been found to have an impact on decisions regarding future health care, family planning, and maternal mental health. The link between parental beliefs and their choices for interventions has not yet been empirically explored.
Conclusions: Research on the impact of cultural beliefs specific to autism is very limited, although studies focusing on other developmental disorders suggest that it is influential.
