The suggestion that measles infection is causally linked to Crohn's disease had been disproved already6 but there has since been a decrease in MMR vaccination uptake with the potential for future morbidity. 7 The basis for the early report was 12 children whose parents had reported the onset of bowel disease and autism soon after MMR vaccination. 5The age when these conditions first appear however, is also the age for MMR vaccination. ;;
The publication of the 'early report' based on only 12 patients resulted in a prodigious correspondence which canvassed the rift which can exist between clinical medicine and public health, 12 and the inadequacy of evidence related to problems of methodology. 11-21 The controversy in that correspondence was whether or not the paper byWakefield5 should have been accepted for publication. It attracted mass media attention and generated considerable public concern despite the lack of evidence linking MMR vaccination with the conditions suffered by the 12 children. ;;","discusses;;

however, indicate the need for further investigation into the possible links
between the autistic syndrome and the prevalence of physiological factors.
Speculation about a possible interplay between autism and various
biochemical systems of the body, such as the immune system (Warren et
al., 1996; Van Gent et al., 1997; Wakeﬁeld et al., 1998), suggests that
speciﬁc behaviours associated with the autistic syndrome could also be
accompanied by speciﬁc physiological problems associated with affected
systems of the body. The ﬁndings that nearly two-thirds of Children
showed a history of eczema or similar skin complaints, and over a quarter
had problems with asthma—related conditions (both exceeding the general
population incidence ﬁgures), imply the involvement of the immune
system in some fashion.;;

1996), which has also been associated with subsequent physiological
difﬁculties such as problems with intestinal permeability (Waring and

between parental and sibling health problems (especially related to
problems of the immune system) and the presence of physiological
symptoms coexisting with the overt diagnostic deﬁnition of autism
supports the View of autism being an organic disorder, either immuno—
logical or metabolic (Shattock and Savery, 1996 ; Wakeﬁeld et al., 1998),

The passage of elevated levels of peptides through to the CNS is further aided by gastrointestinal conditions indicative of an abnormally porous intestinal membrane (Waring and Ngong, 1993; Gardner, 1994; D’Eufemia et al., 1996; Wakefield et al., 1998).

Problems with intestinal permeability have been found in a proportion of children with autism (D’Eufemia et al., 1996).

The increased levels of IAG3 and other, as yet unidentified, compounds found in the urine of people with tenuous autism also provides support for the existence of an abnormally porous intestinal membrane. ;;","describes;;

Increased urine secretion of peptides has been found in celiac disease, probably resulting from increased intestinal uptake of peptides caused by damage to the small gut mucosa.
Methods:
High-performance liquid chromatography of low-molecular-weight peptides in the urine was performed over 6 months, before and after a gluten-free diet was instituted in children who clinically improved while consuming the diet.
Results:
A significant decrease of peptide levels was observed in children consuming the gluten-free diet. Certain peptide peaks thought to be gluten related decreased the most after the patients began the diet.

Although standard medical treatment is often helpful, the under- lying causes of these disorders are not well understood. Furthermore, some individuals respond poorly or not at all to regular medicine. Evidence is accumulating in the medical literature that the enteric nervous system (ENS)—that part of the nervous system associated with the alimen- tary canal—also plays a role in these disorders. Historically, the concept of an autonomous ab- dominal nervous system was advocated by Byron Robinson, Johannis Langley, and Edgar Cayce.

The rapid increase in research endeavour has not kept pace with the advent of well-publicised theories and treatments for autism.
Aims
To explore some of the newer developments in biological research into autism.
Method
A review of recent publications and presentations.
Results
The concept is shifting from the narrow perception of aloof autism, described by Kanner, to a wider one that includes a spectrum extending to a broader, subclinical phenotype. The genetic basis has been established; now we need to discover the location and interaction of the relevant sites. There is considerable interest in the bowel as a pathogenetic agent, particularly in the effects of exogenous opioids and multiple viral infection (the latter posing a public health problem). Also of concern is the role of (potentially treatable) epilepsy, analogous to the Laudau-Kleffner syndrome.
Conclusions
In the absence of a cure, the implementation of ideas will continue to outstrip factual evidence. Clinicians are challenged by the availability of information (and misinformation), particularly on the internet.

Design: Open, uncontrolled trial. Materials and Methods: Sixty-four patients were registered for the study. They included 3 female adults and 2 male adolescents. There was a total of 16 dropouts. Thus there were 48 evaluable patients. Each patient received a complete vial of secretin, irrespective of current age and body weight. Any existing treatment that had already been started before the study began was allowed to continue. No new treatment was permitted for a minimum period of 8 weeks when study surveillance was completed. The parents or guardians performed clinical assessment on a weekly basis, using numerical scoring of symptoms in a questionnaire. The only laboratory study performed was a hair analysis at the outset and at the completion of the 8 weeks of surveillance. Results: Of 48 evaluable patients, there were 39 whose clinical response varied from minor to major behavioral and/or bowel function improvement and 9 in whom there was no sign at all of either a behavioral or gastrointestinal response. Only a few of these patients showed significant abnormalities in hair analysis and there was no significant difference in these changes as compared with a group of children who had been seen at our clinic for reasons other than autistic spectrum. The side effects observed were temporary irritability in a few patients and exacerbation of previously quiescent seizures in one child. Conclusions: We found a clearcut population of clinical ''responders'' as compared with a much smaller group of ''non-responders.'' Little can be said about the dropout patients other than to conclude that total lack of response and expense were the most likely causes. We can certainly encourage and condone the use of secretin as a valuable weapon in attempting treatment of this devastating spectrum of disease. This study has not helped to define the indications to suggest a ''responder'' from a ''non-responder.''

Post-mortem studies on small case series report cellular abnormalities in the limbic system and cerebellum. Between 10 and 20% of subjects with autism have macrocephalia, which is in accordance with MRI findings of an increased total brain tissue volume and enlargement most prominent in the occipital and parietal lobes.

","OBJECTIVE:
Intestinal pathology, i.e., ileocolonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) and mucosal inflammation, has been described in children with developmental disorders. This study describes some of the endoscopic and pathological characteristics in a group of children with developmental disorders (affected children) that are associated with behavioral regression and bowel symptoms, and compares them with pediatric controls.
METHODS:
Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy were performed on 60 affected children (median age 6 yr, range 3–16; 53 male). Developmental diagnoses were autism (50 patients), Asperger's syndrome (five), disintegrative disorder (two), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (one), schizophrenia (one), and dyslexia (one). Severity of ileal LNH was graded (0–3) in both affected children and 37 developmentally normal controls (median age 11 yr, range 2–13 yr) who were investigated for possible inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Tissue sections were reviewed by three pathologists and scored on a standard proforma. Data were compared with ileocolonic biopsies from 22 histologically normal children (controls) and 20 children with ulcerative colitis (UC), scored in an identical manner. Gut pathogens were sought routinely.
RESULTS:
Ileal LNH was present in 54 of 58 (93%) affected children and in five of 35 (14.3%) controls (p < 0.001). Colonic LNH was present in 18 of 60 (30%) affected children and in two of 37 (5.4%) controls (p < 0.01). Histologically, reactive follicular hyperplasia was present in 46 of 52 (88.5%) ileal biopsies from affected children and in four of 14 (29%) with UC, but not in non-IBD controls (p < 0.01). Active ileitis was present in four of 51 (8%) affected children but not in controls. Chronic colitis was identified in 53 of 60 (88%) affected children compared with one of 22 (4.5%) controls and in 20 of 20 (100%) with UC. Scores of frequency and severity of inflammation were significantly greater in both affected children and those with UC, compared with controls (p < 0.001).

In these children, the majority of whom had autism, a period of initial normal development was followed by developmental regression and loss of ac- quired skills, sometimes occurring precipitously over a pe- riod of days to weeks. Long-standing intestinal symptoms, as described previously (1), were typical of this group of children. These symptoms had often started at around the same time as the behavioral changes. ;;
In its persistent acquired form, ileal LNH has been reported in association with infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) before the development of AIDS (10). 
The other consistent feature of the intestinal lesion was a mild-to-moderate colitis that lacked the specific diagnostic features of either Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis (1). This combination of features, i.e., LNH and nonspecific colitis, indicates the possibility of chronic mucosal and/or systemic immune dysregulation. ;;
These immune changes, plus the presence of myelin basic protein (MBP) antibodies (15) and inhibition of macrophage migration to MBP (16), have led some workers to suggest that the behavioural syndrome may be associated with cerebral damage due to an autoimmune response to myelin or other structural compo- nents of the CNS (15, 16). As part of our initial study (1) we undertook cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, EEG, and biochemical analysis of cerebrospinal fluid; none of these investigations indicated cerebral inflammation that would be consistent with autoimmune demyelination, although a more subtle lesion remains a possibility. Alternatively, oth- ers have proposed that some forms of autism may arise from the toxic effects of intestinal products on the developing brain (17–19), a situation that may have some overlap with hepatic enephalopathy. ;;
This study involved the analysis of data from 60 consecutive children with developmental disorders (affected children) including those 12 children described in a preliminary report (1). The median age of the children was 6 yr (range 3–16 yr) and 53 were boys, consistent with the male bias of devel- opmental disorders (20). ;;
All clinical investigations were undertaken with fully in- formed, written consent from the parents. The initial phase of these studies (1) was approved by the Ethical Practices Committee of the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust. There- after, children were investigated according to clinical need after a formal referral from each child’s General Practitioner or Consultant. ;;
LNH (not graded), red halo sign surrounding follicles (21), loss of vascular pattern, mucosal granularity, mucosal erythema, and presence of ulcer(s). These features, which are recognized correlates of associ- ated histopathological abnormality, were noted previously to be characteristic of this patient group (1). These features were recorded both for cases and for non-IBD controls; the data are shown in Figure 3. ;;
The differences between biopsies from affected children and from both non-IBD controls and those with ulcerative colitis are significant (p 􏰌 0.001 and p 􏰌 0.01, respectively). Qualitatively, ileal lymph nodes in those children with LNH showed marked expansion of lymphoid tissue in histological section, as described previously (1). Follicle numbers per biopsy were increased from 2–3 follicles per biopsy in normal ileal biopsies to 4–5 per biopsy in those with LNH: follicles were confluent with loss of follicle-to-follicle de- marcation. ;;
These data both confirm and extend our original observa- tions (1), and indicate a subtle and consistent pattern of intestinal pathology in this cohort of consecutively referred children. The combination of ileocolonic LNH and colitis in children with developmental disorders distinguished them from developmentally normal children with similar symp- toms (including abdominal pain and constipation) in whom LNH and histopathological change were uncommon. ;;

Several disorders have been attributed to measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination during the past decade. The aim of this prospective follow-up study was to identify serious adverse events causally related to MMR vaccination.
Methods.
When the MMR vaccination program was launched in Finland in 1982, a countrywide surveillance system was set up to detect serious adverse events associated with MMR. To obtain detailed case histories vaccinees’ clinical charts were reviewed. Serum samples were analyzed to trace concurrent infections.
Setting.
All hospitals and health centers in Finland from 1982 through 1996.
Results.
Immunization of 1.8 million individuals and consumption of almost 3 million vaccine doses by the end of 1996 gave rise to 173 potentially serious reactions claimed to have been caused by MMR vaccination. In all, 77 neurologic, 73 allergic and 22 miscellaneous reactions and 1 death were reported, febrile seizure being the most common event. However, 45% of these events proved to be probably caused or contributed by some other factor, giving an incidence of serious adverse events with possible or indeterminate causal relation with MMR vaccination of 5.3 per 100 000 vaccinees or 3.2 per 100 000 vaccine doses.
Conclusions.
Causality between immunization and a subsequent untoward event cannot be estimated solely on the basis of a temporal relation. Comprehensive analysis of the reported adverse reactions established that serious events causally related to MMR vaccine are rare and greatly outweighed by the risks of natural MMR diseases.",Final section; “Discussion”;;,"No case of inflammatory bowel disease or autism was detected during this long follow-up study comprising 3 million vaccine doses.

However, children still die from complications of treatment and these are potentially preventable. We have analysed data from three large consecutive national protocols for ALL from 1980 to 1997 [Medical Research Council United Kingdom ALL (MRC UKALL) trials VIII, X and XI] to compare the incidence and causes of treatment‐related deaths (TRD). The percentage of TRD has fallen from 9% to 2% (UKALL VIII to XI), largely as a result of a decrease in fatal infections. Deaths during induction have fallen from 3% to 1%, the main causes of death being bacterial, followed by fungal infection, while other causes, chiefly haemorrhage, have not declined. Remission deaths also decreased from 6% to 1%, particularly those deaths due to measles and pneumocystis carinii. More guidelines for surveillance and treatment of infections have been included within progressively more intensive protocols. Risk factor analysis showed increased TRD in patients with Down's syndrome, high leucocyte count and older age in UKALL XI. In contrast, the introduction of blocks of intensification was not associated with an increased death rate. While improved supportive care has reduced the incidence of TRD, there is still scope for further reduction by prompt treatment of suspected infection. Maintenance of herd immunity remains of vital importance in avoiding deaths from measles.


",Final section; “Discussion”;;,"MRC UKALL VIII was associated with a significant number of fatal pneumonitis episodes (Darbyshire et al, 1985) and the introduction of routine prophylaxis with oral cotrimoxazole resulted in a reduction in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis, as in other trials. Measles in the immune‐suppressed child causes an interstitial pneumonitis for which there is no effective treatment (Gray et al, 1987; Kernahan et al, 1987) and the introduction of routine childhood measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunization in 1988 has fortunately resulted in the virtual abolition of this devastating complication.

An association between mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccination and the onset of symptoms typical of autism has recently been suggested. This has led to considerable concern about the safety of the vaccine.
Methods
A matched case-control study using data derived form the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database. Children with a possible diagnosis of autism will be identified from their electronic health records. All diagnoses will be validated by a detailed review of hospital letters and by using information derived from a parental questionnaire. Ten controls per case will be selected from the database. Conditional logistic regression will be used to assess the association between MMR vaccination and autism. In addition case series analyses will be undertaken to estimate the relative incidence of onset of autism in defined time intervals after vaccination. The study is funded by the United Kingdom Medical Research Council.

Both tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators can be efficiently inhibited by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a protease inhibitor of the serpin family. The human PAI-1 gene is located on chromosome 7q, within or close to a region that has been linked to autism in several linkage studies. Autism seems to be characterized by altered neuronal cytoarchitecture, synaptogenesis and possibly also cellular immune responses. We began addressing the potential involvement of the PAI-1 gene in autistic disorder with this linkage/association study, assessing transmission patterns of the 4G/5G polymorphism in the PAI-1 gene promoter that was previously shown to significantly affect PAI-1 plasma levels.

The US Vital Statistics offer the opportunity to study causes of death broken down by comorbid disease associations. The aim of this study was to analyze the presence of comorbid condi- tions in persons who died from ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. 
METHODS: The numbers of deaths from ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease were retrieved from the computerized 1991–1996 data files of the National Center for Health Statistics. Comorbid associations between other diagnosis and ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease were expressed as age-, gender-, and race-standardized proportional mortality ratios. 
RESULTS: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease showed, in general, similar patterns of comorbidity. Both diseases were associated with similar sets of GI complications, such as intestinal obstruction and stasis, mucosal inflammation and infection, vascular complications, and complications related to fistula and abscess formation. Extraintestinal complica- tions of both IBD involved disorders of the hepatobiliary system, urinary system, and various coagulopathies. Ulcer- ative colitis alone was found to be associated with Hirsch- sprung’s disease and schizophrenia, whereas Crohn’s dis- ease alone was found to be related with osteoporosis and amyloidosis. 
CONCLUSIONS: No completely unexplained or hitherto un- described association was revealed.

One study suggests that children with autism have a unique inflammatory bowel disorder that is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. The appropriate use of new diagnostic tests and novel treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) needs to be clarified

Because of concerns regarding sensitivity and specificity, serologic markers measuring anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies cannot yet replace conventional diagnostic testing for screening or diagnosis of pediatric IBD. Large, prospective, pediatric population-based studies still need to be performed to ascertain their use as a noninvasive screening tool. Genetic studies using thiopurine methyl transferase and measurement of 6-mercaptopurine metabolites appear to be valuable for management of pediatric patients with IBD, in assisting clinicians in optimizing therapeutic response to 6-mercaptopurine, and in identifying individuals at increased risk for drug-induced toxicity. Newer immunomodulatory agents also are being explored in pediatric IBD. Open pilot trials of infliximab (Remicade; Centocor, Malvern, PA) for the treatment of children with Crohn disease that does not respond to conventional management have demonstrated short-term efficacy and safety.

","Background. Combination vaccines contain multiple antigens to protect against several dis- eases simultaneously and have simplified the delivery of childhood immunizations. Children are healthier today because of the use of combi- nation vaccines, and the United States is benefit- ing from record low numbers of vaccine-prevent- able diseases. Despite obvious benefits, concerns and misconceptions exist regarding the safety and efficacy of combination vaccines. 
Methods. A review of the pediatric literature to dispel the common misperceptions and potential barriers to combining vaccines. 
Results. Assurance that combination vaccines approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration undergo extensive testing will help to alleviate concerns regarding safety and efficacy of combination vaccines. Food and Drug Administration standards are rigorous and re- quire that combination vaccines be as safe and effective as each component of the vaccine ad- ministered separately. Combination vaccines have been available for >50 years, and lessons learned during this time are continuously ap- plied to the development and use of new prod- ucts. 
Conclusions. Children will benefit from new combination vaccines because fewer injections will be required to protect against vaccine- preventable diseases, allowing for the introduc- tion of new vaccines into the immunization schedule and prevention of additional diseases.

2002,10.1002/mrdd.10029,doi.org,The epidemiology of autistic spectrum disorders: is the prevalence rising?,"For decades after Kanner's original paper on the subject was published in 1943, autism was generally considered to be a rare condition with a prevalence of around 2–4 per 10,000 children. Then, studies carried out in the late 1990s and the present century reported annual rises in incidence of autism in pre‐school children, based on age of diagnosis, and increases in the age‐specific prevalence rates in children. Prevalence rates of up to 60 per 10,000 for autism and even more for the whole autistic spectrum were reported. Reasons for these increases are discussed. They include changes in diagnostic criteria, development of the concept of the wide autistic spectrum, different methods used in studies, growing awareness and knowledge among parents and professional workers and the development of specialist services, as well as the possibility of a true increase in numbers. Various environmental causes for a genuine rise in incidence have been suggested, including the triple vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR]. Not one of the possible environmental causes, including MMR, has been confirmed by independent scientific investigation, whereas there is strong evidence that complex genetic factors play a major role in etiology. The evidence suggests that the majority, if not all, of the reported rise in incidence and prevalence is due to changes in diagnostic criteria and increasing awareness and recognition of autistic spectrum disorders. Whether there is also a genuine rise in incidence remains an open question.

Whilst being welcome, this progress to earlier referral and diagnosis presents new challenges to clinical practice, including the accuracy and stability of early diagnosis, the utility of standardised assessment instruments with young pre‐schoolers and the ability to indicate prognosis. Method: A selective review of recent research literature on the characteristic features of ASD in pre‐school children. Results: Multidisciplinary diagnostic assessment should include detailed information on developmental history, parents' descriptions of the everyday behaviour and activities of the child, direct assessment of the child's social interaction style, including where possible with age peers, and formal assessment of communicative, intellectual and adaptive function. Clinical assessments need to concentrate on the identification of impairments in early non‐verbal social communication behaviours that characterise children with ASD from the second year of life, including social orienting, joint attention, imitation, play and reciprocal affective behaviour. The particular pattern of symptoms that presents in a 2‐year‐old with ASD may differ from that seen at the more prototypic age of 4 or 5 years. In particular, overt repetitive and stereotyped behaviours may be less notable, although where these are seen alongside the social and communicative impairments they are highly indicative of ASD. The use of standardised assessment instruments and the strict application of the DSM and ICD diagnostic criteria need to be employed with caution, as an expert clinical view has been shown to be more accurate. An important aspect of early diagnostic consultation is an open and straightforward approach to the negotiation of the diagnostic view with parents over time. Conclusions: Earlier diagnosis and rising recognition of ASD have significant implications for primary healthcare and specialist diagnostic and therapeutic services.

","Autism is a lifelong condition usually described as affecting social, cognitive and imaginative abilities. For many years, parents and some professionals have observed that in concordance with the behavioural and psychological symptoms of the condition, there are a number of physiological and biochemical correlates which may also be of relevance to the syndrome. One area of interest that encompasses many of these observations is the opioid-excess theory of autism. The main premise of this theory is that autism is the result of a metabolic disorder. Peptides with opioid activity derived from dietary sources, in particular foods that contain gluten and casein, pass through an abnormally permeable intestinal membrane and enter the central nervous system (CNS) to exert an effect on neurotransmission, as well as producing other physiologically-based symptoms. Numerous parents and professionals worldwide have found that removal of these exogenously derived compounds through exclusion diets can produce some amelioration in autistic and related behaviours. There is a surprisingly long history of research accompanying these ideas. The aim of this paper is to review the accompanying evidence in support of this theory and present new directions of intervention as a result of it.",middle section;“Opioid-excess theory of autism ”;;,"The significance of gastrointestinal disturbances associated with autism has also begun to receive attention in research literature [40].

More controversially, it is suggested that persistent measles infections that result from the com- bined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine may trigger autism by causing intestinal permeability in a subgroup of children who develop symptoms of autism within a short period of receiving the vaccine.

","We have reported lymphocytic colitis in children with regressive autism, with epithelial damage prominent. We now compare duodenal biopsies in 25 children with regressive autism to 11 with coeliac disease, five with cerebral palsy and mental retardation and 18 histologically normal controls. Immunohistochemistry was performed for lymphocyte and epithelial lineage and functional markers. We determined the density of intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocyte populations, and studied mucosal immunoglobulin and complement C1q localisation. Standard histopathology showed increased enterocyte and Paneth cell numbers in the autistic children. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased lymphocyte infiltration in both epithelium and lamina propria with upregulated crypt cell proliferation, compared to normal and cerebral palsy controls. Intraepithelial lymphocytes and lamina propria plasma cells were lower than in coeliac disease, but lamina propria T cell populations were higher and crypt proliferation similar. Most strikingly, IgG deposition was seen on the basolateral epithelial surface in 23/25 autistic children, co-localising with complement C1q. This was not seen in the other conditions. These findings demonstrate a novel form of enteropathy in autistic children, in which increases in mucosal lymphocyte density and crypt cell proliferation occur with epithelial IgG deposition.

In addition to frequent gastrointestinal symptoms, children with autism often manifest complex biochemical and immunological abnormalities. The gut–brain axis is central to certain encephalopathies of extra‐cranial origin, hepatic encephalopathy being the best characterized.
Commonalities in the clinical characteristics of hepatic encephalopathy and a form of autism associated with developmental regression in an apparently previously normal child, accompanied by immune‐mediated gastrointestinal pathology, have led to the proposal that there may be analogous mechanisms of toxic encephalopathy in patients with liver failure and some children with autism. Aberrations in opioid biochemistry are common to these two conditions, and there is evidence that opioid peptides may mediate certain aspects of the respective syndromes. The generation of plausible and testable hypotheses in this area may help to identify new treatment options in encephalopathies of extra‐cranial origin.
Therapeutic targets for this autistic phenotype may include: modification of diet and entero‐colonic microbial milieu in order to reduce toxin substrates, improve nutritional status and modify mucosal immunity; anti‐inflammatory/immunomodulatory therapy; and specific treatment of dysmotility, focusing, for example, on the pharmacology of local opioid activity in the gut.","middle section;“THE GUT IN AUTISM: CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND SUBCLINICAL DISEASE”;;

Better at times to be vaguely right, we argue, rather than precisely wrong.

It is not the intention of this article to either refute or substantiate the ongoing controversy, as this is obviously a scientific debate, butrather to offer an overview of the studies to date in the interest ofhelping practitioners in the frontline to engage in informed debate with concerned parents. The conclusions from this review stem from twomajor studies conducted by the Institute of Medicine (IoM, 2001) in theUSA, and the Medical Research Council (MRC, 2001) in the UK. Both conclude that although epidemiological studies so far do notsupport a link between MMR and autism, nonetheless the studies havebeen too imprecise to rule out the prospect of the vaccination beinginvolved in a small number of cases, and the need for further researchhas been pointed out.","middle section;“WAKEFIELD ET AL’S (1998) STUDY ”;;

Conclusion;;","Wakefield et al’s (1998) study is generally credited with initiating the MMR vaccine con- troversy. The study describes how a total of 12 children, 11 boys and 1 girl aged between 3 and 10 years, with a mean age of 6 years, were referred to the gastroenterology unit at the Royal Free Hospital, London, with a history of normal development followed by a loss of acquired skills, including language, together with diarrhoea and abdominal pain. ;;
Nine were diagnosed as autistic, one with degenerative psychosis and two with possible postviral or vaccinal encephalitis. The authors concluded: 
‘We did not find an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described’ (Wakefield et al, 1998). 
Although they stated that they did not find a link they postulated that MMR leads to a non-specific gut condition, ‘leaky gut syn- drome’, permitting the absorption of non-per- meable peptides, including vaccines. ;;
Kastner and Gellin (2001) acknowledge that such a ‘leak’ may be plausible but questioned why this ‘leak’ would be in one direction only or so specific as to permit the passage of some molecules but not other similar ones. Following Wakefield et al’s (1998) allega- tions, there have been many studies investi- gating a possible link between MMR and autism, all of which have rejected a causal link. These studies include Peltola et al (1998), Gillberg and Heijbel (1998), Taylor et al (1999), Patja et al (2000), Fombonne and Chakrabarti (2001), and Kaye et al (2001). ;;
The parents of these children claim that MMR was the trigger. 
Wakefield et al (1998) have suggested one mode of action by which the MMR vaccine can trigger autism, i.e. the gastrointestinal route, although the exact mechanism is unclear. ;;
Despite the voluminous reports, publicity, anec- dotal evidence and debate that Wakefield et al’s (1998) report has generated over the past 4 years, and the overwhelming scientific opin- ion that argues against a link between MMR vaccine and ASD, the controversy continues. This leads to considerable unease in the prac- tice situation because the evidence does not support a link and therefore the DoH continues to promote MMR uptake, although this task can prove difficult when such controversy sur- rounds the issue.

","Public tolerance to adverse reactions is minimal. Several reporting systems have been established to monitor adverse events following immunization. The present review summarizes data on neurologic complications following vaccination, and provides evidence that indicates whether they were directly associated with the vaccines. These complications include autism (measles vaccine), multiple sclerosis (hepatitis B vaccine), meningoencephalitis (Japanese encephalitis vaccine), Guillain-Barre syndrome and giant cell arteritis (influenza vaccine), and reactions after exposure to animal rabies vaccine. Seizures and hypotonic/hyporesponsive episodes following pertussis vaccination and potential risks associated with varicella vaccination, as well as vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis following oral poliovirus vaccination, are also described.

Some element of risk was accepted as inevitable withinlife. The three ethnic groups had different exposure to media publicityabout the risks of MMR, largely linked to command of English. Pakistaniwomen believed that health professionals gave them the best advice aboutchildhood immunisation, but Afro-Caribbean and Somali womenexpressed a desire for more information from health professionals,particularly written information about immunisation which is inclusiveof Black people and available in translation.Conclusions This small qualitative study suggests that ethnic minorityparents perceive the benefits of childhood immunisation as greatlyoutweighing the risks.

","The prevalence of childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD) is unknown. In this study, 32 epidemiological surveys of autism and pervasive developmental disorders published in English language journals since 1966 were reviewed. Four surveys yielded estimates for CDD ranging from 1.1 to 6.4 per 100,000 subjects. A pooled estimate across these four surveys is 1.7 per 100,000 (95 percent Confidence Interval: 0.6-3.8 per 100,000).

The importance of differentiating CDD from autism is illustrated by recent reports of patterns of regression in the developmental course of children with pervasive developmental disorders possibly linked to measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) immunization (Wakefield et al., 1998; 2000). Although the precise clinical phenotype of this putative variant of autism has not been described with adequate precision (Fombonne and Chakrabarti, 2001), almost all these children are reported to have shown regression in their development after a period of presumably normal development (Wakefield et al., 2000).

Two participants would not rule out that the MMR immunization might be the causation for their children’s disabilities. Wakefield et al.’s (1998) study supporting this link focused on anecdotal evidence; however, the authors performed no scientific analyses to substantiate their theory. In at least four of the 12 cases reported in the study, behavioural problems appeared before the onset of symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease: that is, the effect preceded the proposed cause. ;;

","In 1998, a report was published describing 12 patients with inflammatory bowel conditions and regressive developmental disorders consisting primarily of autism. The authors hypothesised that MMR vaccine may have been responsible for the bowel dysfunction which subsequently resulted in the neurodevelopmental disorders. The suggestion that measles vaccine may cause autism through a persistent bowel infection generated much interest since it provided a possible biological mechanism for a causal association. Epidemiological studies, however, have not found an association between MMR vaccination and autism. Autism has a strong genetic component and its associated neurological defects probably occur during embryonic development. It seems unlikely that a vaccination that is given after birth could cause autism. In a minority of cases, autism may have onset after 1 year of age (regressive autism) but the one epidemiological study that included such cases did not find an association with MMR vaccination. Currently, the weight of the available epidemiological and related evidence does not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism.

In a minority of cases, however, a child can appear to be developing completely normally but then regresses and develops autistic characteristics. It is such cases of regressive disorders, as noted by Wakefield [1], for which a bio- logically plausible link with vaccination could be made. Thus, the analyses of Taylor and colleagues that found no association between vaccination and onset of regression provide particu- larly persuasive evidence against the hypothesis that MMR may cause autism or exacerbate its symptomatology. ;;
Some parents have reported that the onset of autism in their children occurred following an adverse reaction to vac- cines, such as a convulsion or loss of consciousness. Such reactions were noted in 6 of the 12 cases reported by Wake- field [1]. Adverse reactions to vaccines do occur but, for the most part, these tend to be minor and resolve rather quickly.

Other epidemiological studies have confirmed these negative findings.7 
The pattern of bowel abnormalities identified in the Wakefield et al1 case series was described as a specific ‘autistic enterocolitis’. The case for such an entity has not been proven and there are strong arguments8 against the biological plausibility of the sequence sug- gested as leading to the onset of autism—whereby a previously normal child receives MMR vaccine, develops bowel problems (‘autistic enterocolitis’) which leads to abnormal absorption of dietary or diges- tive constituents and the child then undergoes devel- opmental and/or behavioural regression (‘regressive autism’). ;;
This ‘new-variant’ autism has been incrimi- nated as the cause of the apparent increase in the prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders, although Fombonne9 has presented evidence that the observed increase does not reflect a real rise. 
Although the original paper1 described a short inter- val between vaccination and symptoms, Wakefield has recently postulated10 that the onset of MMR-induced ‘regressive autism’ may occur after a prolonged induc- tion interval and requires in addition co-factors such as an intercurrent infection, the child receiving anti- biotics, atopy in the child, a strong family history of autoimmune disease or maternal MMR or rubella immunisation shortly before, during or after preg- nancy.

Research has focused on the physiological and behavioural effects of dietary change but has not examined the effect of exclusion diets on nutritional intake.
Aims The aim of this study was to examine whether the removal of major dietary staples placed children with autism at risk of nutrient deficiency and compares their food choice with ASD children not following gluten and/or casein free diets.
Methods A postal questionnaire was sent to parents of children aged 3–16 years, diagnosed with ASD belonging to the National Autistic Society in Leicestershire and southern Derbyshire. Detailed dietary information and a 3‐day food diary were collected. The sample size was small: those using gluten/casein free diets (n = 8) and those not following diet (n = 29).
Results Nutrient intakes fell below the Lower Reference Nutrient Intake (LRNI) in 12 children (32%) for zinc, calcium, iron, vitamin A, vitamin B12 and riboflavin in the nondiet group and four children (50%) for zinc and calcium in the diet group. Fruit and vegetable intakes were higher and cereal, bread and potato consumption were lower in those children using gluten and/or casein free diets.
Conclusion No significant differences in the energy, protein and micronutrient intakes were found between the two groups of children. A longitudinal prospective study is suggested to examine whether differences in food choice are the result of dietary intervention or the prerequisite for the successful application of diet in this special group of children.

However, in many children referred to us, parental reports suggest a temporal relationship with exposure to the measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine (Wakefield et al., 1998), an association reported by others (Jyonouchi, Sun, & Le, 2001).

Many efforts have been made to explore the biologic basis of this disorder, but the etiology remains unknown. Recent publications describing upper gastrointestinal abnormalities and ileocolitis have focused attention on gastrointestinal function and morphology in these children. High prevalence of histologic abnormalities in the esophagus, stomach, small intestine and colon, and dysfunction of liver conjugation capacity and intestinal permeability were reported. Three surveys conducted in the United States described high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autistic disorder. Treatment of the digestive problems may have positive effects on their behavior.

Anxiety has risen steadily since the mid-1990s, when a medical investigative team led by A Wakefield postulated that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine may be a causative factor in the development of autism spectrum disorder. Since this initial publication, immunization remains controversial for some parents and the uptake of the MMR vaccine has fallen in some countries, despite much discussion regarding the safety of MMR, a lack of evidence for an association between MMR and autism, and the risks of insufficient protection against wild measles virus infection. The Canadian uptake of MMR in 1998 was 95%, but data do not exist to document any change in Canada since that time. Many clinicians are concerned that the uptake in younger siblings of children with autism is considerably lower.
Further anxiety for parents has been caused by the suggested association between developmental disorders and mercury toxicity due to thimerosal, which is used as a preservative in some vaccines. Many Canadian parents, while continuing to seek chelation therapy in response to this suggestion, are not aware that, in Canada, thimerosal has never been added to MMR, and has not been present in diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus-poliomyelitis or pentavalent vaccines since 1992. It is found in only Hepatitis B vaccine in some provinces.

","BACKGROUND
It has been suggested that vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) is a cause of autism.
METHODS
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all children born in Denmark from January 1991 through December 1998. The cohort was selected on the basis of data from the Danish Civil Registration System, which assigns a unique identification number to every live-born infant and new resident in Denmark. MMR-vaccination status was obtained from the Danish National Board of Health. Information on the children's autism status was obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register, which contains information on all diagnoses received by patients in psychiatric hospitals and outpatient clinics in Denmark. We obtained information on potential confounders from the Danish Medical Birth Registry, the National Hospital Registry, and Statistics Denmark.
RESULTS
Of the 537,303 children in the cohort (representing 2,129,864 person-years), 440,655 (82.0 percent) had received the MMR vaccine. We identified 316 children with a diagnosis of autistic disorder and 422 with a diagnosis of other autistic-spectrum disorders. After adjustment for potential confounders, the relative risk of autistic disorder in the group of vaccinated children, as compared with the unvaccinated group, was 0.92 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.24), and the relative risk of another autistic-spectrum disorder was 0.83 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.07). There was no association between the age at the time of vaccination, the time since vaccination, or the date of vaccination and the development of autistic disorder.
CONCLUSIONS
This study provides strong evidence against the hypothesis that MMR vaccination causes autism.

Eighteen parents of autistic probands with a history of language regression and 70 parents of autistic probands without regression were assessed for features of the BAP and compared with published rates in parents of nonautistic subjects. Parents of probands with regressive and nonregressive autism demonstrated similar rates of the BAP (27.8% vs. 32.9%; P = 0.33). The rate of the BAP was significantly higher in both groups of autism parents than in parents of nonautistic subjects (P ≤ 0.01). Thus, this measure of genetic liability is increased equally in families with both forms of autism when compared with controls. Environmental events are therefore unlikely to be the sole cause of regressive autism in our sample. Environmental events, however, may act in an additive or “second‐hit” fashion in individuals with a genetic vulnerability to autism. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Later a possible association between infection by the measles virus and inflammatory bowel disease was proposed and subse- quently the same authors suggested a link between autism, measles and MMR vaccine. ;;
In Finland a study of people with long-term Crohn’s disease showed no increase in incidence following the introduction of MMR vaccination (Peltola et al, 1986).

Examples are the harms of mercury contained in various vaccines, such as the triple viral (MMR), causing inflammatory bowel disease and autism; hepatitis B and multiple sclerosis vaccine; the SV40 virus in polio and cancer vaccines; reverse transcriptase in chick embryo cells and risks of retrovirus infection; vaccines as a cause of asthma, insulin-dependent diabetes. In some situations there has been clear damage to the health of the population, as happened in England after alarming news about the risks of the triple DTP vaccine in the 1970s and, more recently, the triple viral vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella, also in England, and the hepatitis B vaccine in France. In addition, anti-vaccine activist groups broadcast alarming news through the media, especially the Internet. This situation benefits people and lawyers who, with or without scientific basis for their claims, seek millionaire compensation, which has caused harm to the population, especially in countries like the United States, by increasing the cost of vaccines to make the lawsuits, and the withdrawal of production by several companies, contributing to crises of availability of vaccines.

The highly selective lesson was that seeking to reassure the public about a relatively small risk is disastrous - which it certainly was for the Conservative government at the time. It is now deemed necessary to advertise prominently even the smallest possible risk. This is the rationale behind the recently established Food Standards Agency, which was vigorously promoting the purely theoretical risk of BSE infection through sheep in 2001, for example. Other factors particular to British society have fostered an alarmist response to cell phone EMF at odds with that of other European countries such as Holland.

While this article will review the clinical, anatomic, and pathologic features seen in autism, the primary focus will be to present a new and provocative unifying theory regarding the underlying mechanisms causing this disorder. Current research advances, some controversial, will be discussed, and a novel definition of autism as a “circuit syndrome” will be presented. The work elaborated here will tie many of the disparate findings together, based on the idea that autism arises from abnormalities of the cerebellolimbic circuitry. Some of the more alternative theories of autism, such as mercury toxicity, linkage to the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, and the use of secretin will be discussed. Finally, pharmacologic treatment options will be reviewed.

Possibly, a breakthrough will re- sult after publication of several studies reporting new ob- servations of significant gastrointestinal pathology in autism or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (14-17). In this 
review, the new observations, particularly those on the in- testinal tract, are described, as well as earlier studies indi- cating a link between gastrointestinal function and autism.;;
In a study published in 1998, 12 children diagnosed with autism (all of the regressive pattern) and exhibiting a variety of GI ailments, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloating, were examined extensively (14). The GI symptoms had developed coincident with the onset of au- tistic behavior, according to the parents. ;;
Secretin, a peptide hormone released by endocrine cells within the duodenal mucosa, promotes sodium bicarbonate and water secretion by the pancreas. It is important to note that this study describes altered function in the upper GI tract of autistic children, whereas the lym- phoid nodular hyperplasia described by Wakefield et al. (14, 15) was observed in the lowest portion of the small intestine, namely the ileum. The results of these different studies taken together suggest that significant and wide- spread GI pathophysiology may accompany autism, at least within a subpopulation of patients. ;;
Pathological inflammation of the intestinal mucosa has long been recognized as a primary symptom in celiac dis- ease and inflammatory bowel disease. The recent work de- tailed above indicates that there is also pathological inflam- mation of the ileum in autism (14-17), although there is no evidence to support the view that gluten or casein cause the inflammation. Intestinal inflammation can be regarded as the consequence of the disruption of the complex interaction between all of the ceIls of the mucosa (immune and non- immune), ;;
In Crohn's disease, blood proteins are lost into the intestinal lumen and are excreted into the feces; the extent of protein loss correlates positively with the length of the bowel that is inflamed (53). In the study by Wakefield et al. (14) examination of histological sections of intestinal tissue from autistic patients revealed a near doubling of the num- ber of lymphoid follicles, as weIl as follicle enlargement and merging of adjacent follicles. More recently, Furlano et al. (54) reported that neutrophils and lymphocytes infiltrated the epithelium overlying the follicles; neutrophils also in- filtrated the crypt epithelium that lies between the villi and provides a constant supply of new epithelial cells for the villi. ;;
There was no evidence that the enterocytes themselves were ren- dered more permeable, as occurs in celiac disease, wherein a near total loss of the intestinal cell lining is manifest. In keeping with this distinction, the pathology reported to oc- cur in the ileum of autistic subjects (14-17) is much more subtle than that observed in celiac disease. These consider- ations do not disaIlow a role for gluten and casein in intes- tinal hyperpermeability. ;;
Lacking is any evidence that gliadin and milk proteins, or their products, produce these cytokines in the autistic gut. Vaccines. The intestinal pathology noted in the study of Wakefield et al. (14), namely, the hyperplastic lymph nodes in the ileum and colon, suggests that the immune system of the gut has been seriously challenged in the au- tistic patients. Although Wakefield et al. did not draw a conclusion as to the cause of the pathology, they noted parental reports that the children had received the trivalent measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine before undergoing behavioral regression. ;;
Autistic individuals frequently exhibit mental retarda- tion as well as unusual behaviors such as perseveration. These are indications of impaired CNS function ( I , 85). The studies described above provide evidence that, in autism, much of the GI tract, extending from the esophagus to the colon, possesses pathology (14-17). The possibility cannot be discounted that any GI pathology that exists is unrelated to the function of the CNS. ;;
Myelin is necessary for nor- mal conduction of the action potential in myelinated nerve fibers. Wakefield et al. (14) observed that, in conjunction with the intestinal pathology observed in his autistic popu- lation, vitamin B12 absorption was significantly reduced in all eight autistic individuals in which urinary methylmalonic acid excretion was measured. Methylmalonic acid is nor- mally converted to succinyl coenzyme A by a vitamin B I 2 dependent mutase.;; 
Dietary vitamin BJ2 deficiency results in impaired mutase activity and spillover of methylmalonic acid into the urine. Wakefield et al. (14) proposed that nerve myelogenesis, which is dependent upon vitamin B12' may be impaired in autistic children as a result. Direct evidence of vitamin B I 2 deficiency and impaired myelogenesis in autism is lacking at this time. ;;","cites for information;;

","Abstract
Background. 
An outbreak of measles occurred in Ireland between December 1999 and July 2000. The majority of cases were in north Dublin, the catchment area of The Children’s University Hospital (TCUH).
Methods. 
Details of all of the 111 children attending the hospital with a diagnosis of measles between December 1999 and July 2000 were prospectively entered into a database. Charts were subsequently reviewed to extract epidemiologic and clinical details. National figures were obtained from the National Disease Surveillance Centre.
Results. 
In the study period 355 attended TCUH with a serologic or clinical diagnosis of measles, and 111 were admitted (47% female, 53% male). The main indications for admission were dehydration in 79%, pneumonia or pneumonitis in 47% and tracheitis in 32%. Thirteen children (11.7% of those admitted) required treatment in the intensive care unit, and in 7 of these mechanical ventilation was necessary. There were 3 deaths as a result of measles. Public health measures to curb spread of the disease included promotion of immunization for susceptible children nationally and recommending administration of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) from the age of 6 months, in North Dublin.
Conclusion. 
This outbreak of measles posed a major challenge to the hospital and the community for the first half of 2000. The national MMR immunization rate before the outbreak was gravely suboptimal at 79%, whereas the rate in North Dublin, the catchment area of TCUH, was <70%. Three children died as a result of a vaccine-preventable illness.",Final section; “Discussion”;;,"Parents are confused by mixed messages from the medical profession and the media as to whether vaccines are safe.

Developmental Disorders ","OBJECTIVE: A relationship between autism and gastrointes- tinal (GI) immune dysregulation has been postulated based on incidence of GI complaints as well as macroscopically observed lymphonodular hyperplasia and microscopically determined enterocolitis in pediatric patients with autism. To evaluate GI immunity, we quantitatively assessed levels of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-1􏰃, produced by intestinal biopsies of children with pervasive developmental disorders. 
METHODS: Fifteen patients, six with pervasive developmen- tal disorders and nine age-matched controls, presenting for diagnostic colonoscopy were enrolled. Endoscopic biopsies were organ cultured, supernatants were harvested, and IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1􏰃 levels were quantified by ELISA. Tissue histology was evaluated by blinded pathologists. 
RESULTS: Concentrations of IL-6 from intestinal organ cul- ture supernatants of patients with pervasive developmental disorders (median 318.5 pg/ml, interquartile range 282.0– 393.0 pg/ml) when compared with controls (median 436.9 pg/ml, interquartile range 312.6–602.5 pg/ml) were not significantly different (p 􏰇 0.0987). Concentrations of IL-8 (median 84,000 pg/ml, interquartile range 16,000–143,000 pg/ml) when compared with controls (median 177,000 pg/ ml, interquartile range 114,000–244,000 pg/ml) were not significantly different (p 􏰇 0.0707). Concentrations of IL-1􏰃 (median 0.0 pg/ml, interquartile range 0.0–94.7 pg/ ml) when compared with controls (median 0.0 pg/ml, inter- quartile range 0.0–60.2 pg/ml) were not significantly dif- ferent (p 􏰇 0.8826). Tissue histology was nonpathological for all patients. 
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated no significant differ- ence in production of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1􏰃 between patients with pervasive developmental disorders and age-matched controls. In general, intestinal levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were lower in patients with pervasive developmental disorders than in age-matched controls. These data fail to support an association between autism and GI inflammation. (Am J Gastroenterol 2003;98:1777–1782. © 2003 by Am. Coll. of Gastroenterology) 
",introduction;;,"The etiology and pathogenesis of pervasive developmental disorders remain unknown, but recent investigations have identified developmental abnormalities of the limbic system and cerebellar–cortical connections, immune system dys- regulation, and GI dysfunction as possible mechanisms (2– 4). 
A relationship between GI immune dysregulation and autism has been postulated based on incidence of GI com- plaints, macroscopic observations of lymphonodular hyper- plasia (LNH), and histological findings of enterocolitis in pediatric patients with autism (5–7). In a cohort of 60 patients with both developmental disorders and intestinal symptoms, Wakefield et al. reported the presence of ileal and colonic LNH in a significantly higher number of pa- tients with autism compared with controls (7).

Physician education of families and care of patients in these three topic areas are important public health measures. First, pediatricians are always actively promoting public health through immunization, so the 2003 vaccination recommendations are critiqued along with perceived barriers to proper immunization. New information about smallpox vaccine is included in this year's review because of increased concerns about the use of smallpox as a weapon of bioterrorism since the world events in recent years. Next, the continued study of the management of hyperbilirubinemia in preventing kernicterus is examined. Finally, the management and prevention of animal-induced injuries is reviewed. In each of these areas, the pediatrician plays a prominent role in promoting the health and well being of children.

The epidemiology of autism has generated much discussion and research; we report the most recent data, as well as recent findings about controversial issues purporting to cause the increased prevalence rate observed in the past decade. Finally, we discuss the prognosis for individuals with autism, indicating the challenges faced by patients, families, and professionals aiming to optimize their outcome.
",middle section;“Clinical Correlates of Autism ”;;,"The issue of regression in autism came to the forefront as part of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine controversy. A 1998 article appearing in Lancet described a small group of children with autism who had diarrhea (referred to as autistic enterocolitis) and who lost previously acquired developmen- tal skills after receiving an MMR vaccine at age 15 months (51). However, another study found that 17% of the children had bowel symptoms and that this rate did not change over the 20-year period for which data were examined and which included the introduction of the MMR vaccine in 1988 (50).

In this study, we postulated that infectious agent antigens such as streptokinase, dietary peptides (gliadin and casein) and ethyl mercury (xenobiotic) bind to different lymphocyte receptors and tissue enzyme (DPP IV or CD26). We assessed this hypothesis first by measuring IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies against CD26, CD69, streptokinase (SK), gliadin and casein peptides and against ethyl mercury bound to human serum albumin in patients with autism. A significant percentage of children with autism developed anti-SK, anti-gliadin and casein peptides and anti-ethyl mercury antibodies, concomitant with the appearance of anti-CD26 and anti-CD69 autoantibodies. These antibodies are synthesized as a result of SK, gliadin, casein and ethyl mercury binding to CD26 and CD69, indicating that they are specific. Immune absorption demonstrated that only specific antigens, like CD26, were capable of significantly reducing serum anti-CD26 levels. However, for direct demonstration of SK, gliadin, casein and ethyl mercury to CD26 or CD69, microtiter wells were coated with CD26 or CD69 alone or in combination with SK, gliadin, casein or ethyl mercury and then reacted with enzyme labeled rabbit anti-CD26 or anti-CD69. Adding these molecules to CD26 or CD69 resulted in 28–86 % inhibition of CD26 or CD69 binding to anti-CD26 or anti-CD69 antibodies. The highest % binding of these antigens or peptides to CD26 or CD69 was attributed to SK and the lowest to casein peptides. We, therefore, propose that bacterial antigens (SK), dietary peptides (gliadin, casein) and Thimerosal (ethyl mercury) in individuals with pre-disposing HLA molecules, bind to CD26 or CD69 and induce antibodies against these molecules. In conclusion, this study is apparently the first to demonstrate that dietary peptides, bacterial toxins and xenobiotics bind to lymphocyte receptors and/or tissue enzymes, resulting in autoimmune reaction in children with autism.",introduction;;,"If covalent adducts of drugs or other chemical compounds are formed in GALT, it seems reasonable that they may lead to immune responses and chemically-induced Type-I-Type IV allergic reactions (10). 
Many infectious agents including measles, Rubella virus and Cytomegalovirus have long been suspected as etiologic factors in autism (I 1- 13). In fact, by reviewing the scientific literature, we found that over 60 different microbial peptides have been reported to cross-react with human brain tissue and MBP that induce T-cell responses but can also induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (14-16).

","Despite the extensive media exposure that viruses such as West Nile, Norwalk, and Ebola have received lately, and the emerging threat that old pathogens may reappear as new agents of terrorism, measles virus (MV) persists as one of the leading causes of death by infectious agents worldwide, approaching the annual mor- tality rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1. For most MV victims, fatality is indirect: Virus-induced transient immunosuppression predisposes the individual to op- portunistic infections that, left untreated, can result in mortality. In rare cases, MV may also cause progressive neurodegenerative disease. During the past five years (1998– 2002), development of animal models and the application of reverse genetics and immunological assays have collectively contributed to major progress in our under- standing of MV biology and pathogenesis. Nevertheless, questions and controversies remain that are the basis for future research. In this review, major advances and current debates are discussed, including MV receptor usage, the cellular basis of immunosup- pression, the suspected role of MV in “nonviral” diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Paget’s disease, and the controversy surrounding MV vaccine safety. 
",middle section;“MEASLES VACCINATION ”;;,"It is certain that the most contentious debate in the measles field concerns the role that vaccines, such as the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, may play in childhood autism. The controversy, sparked by a report in Lancet (128) that hypothesized an association between onset of autistic behaviors and MV RNA sequences in the gut, has deeply penetrated the public consciousness, and many parents are expressing doubts about the value of vaccinating their children. The Lancet report resonated, in part, because many parents of autistic children recalled strong adverse responses to the MMR vaccine (fever, constant crying) and noted a profound loss of acquired skills following vaccine delivery.

These mixed findings may have been related to external factors, such as intermittent reports in the media claiming that MMR vacci- nation may cause autism (Wakefieldet al., 1998).In addition, immunizations are often given at schools, health fairs, and other locations that make accurate recording in health plan claims data challenging.

The authors described 12 children who had chronic enterocolitis associated with a regressive developmental disorder.9 After a period of apparent normality, these children were said to have lost acquired skills, including communication;;
By 2001 they claimed to have found similar colonic lesions in over 150 children with autism, in whom the main gastrointestinal presentation was abdominal pain with either constipation or diarrhea.10 
The most worrisome feature of The Lancet article was a suggestion that the autistic syndrome was precipitated by measles-mumps- rubella (MMR) vaccination.9 This conclusion was based mainly on the fact that, in eight patients, the onset of behavioral problems was linked, by either the parents or the child’s physician, with MMR vaccination. ;;
Nevertheless, it caused great consternation among parents and some health professionals. Although the authors acknowledged in their article that they had not proved an association between MMR vaccination and the proposed syndrome,9 there were adverse comments about the safety of the MMR vaccine at the press conference that launched the publication.12 
Few issues in health care are as emotive as the safety of vaccines to be administered to children. ;;
A new study from California points to the same conclusion.26 
Five years after the controversial report in The Lancet,9 parents and health professionals can have considerable confidence in the safety of the MMR vaccine. If vaccination did occasionally cause an unusual variant of autism, this occurrence would have to be so rare as to escape detection in well-designed epidemiologic studies. ;;

To review the recent literature on possible causes of the increase in frequency of diagnosed autism reported from three countries, and to compare the medical diagnoses and drug therapy from a new series of autistic boys and their mothers with that of comparable nonautistic boys and their mothers.
Design. Case‐control evaluation.
Participants. Members of over 250 general practices in the United Kingdom.
Measurements and Main Results. Frequency of exposure to drugs and presence of preexisting clinical illnesses in autistic children and their mothers were compared with nonautistic children and their mothers over time. According to published studies, the incidence of boys diagnosed with autism rose dramatically in the 1990s. Numerous published studies have concluded that the measles‐mumps‐rubella vaccine is not responsible for the large rise in diagnosed autism. In our study, boys diagnosed with autism had medical and drug histories, such as vaccines, before diagnosis, that were closely similar to those of nonautistic boys, except that developmental and sensory disorders were far more common in autistic boys. No material differences during pregnancy were found between the mothers of autistic boys and those of nonautistic boys in relation to illness or drug therapy. In the early 1990s, boys with diagnosed developmental disorders were infrequently diagnosed with autism. In the later 1990s, such boys more often were diagnosed with autism.
Conclusion. A major cause of the recent large increase in the number of boys diagnosed with autism probably is due to changing diagnostic practices.

Interest in the risks and causes of autism was stimulated by a 1998 report of a small series of cases of autism that were related in time to receipt of the MMR vaccine, with subsequent development of a chronic intestinal disorder.5 Based on this case series, the authors postulated that the MMR vaccine might be causally related to risk of autism. ;;
Our study is consistent with an increase in incidence of autism in recent birth cohorts.”6 
The authors of the 1998 article5 responded with a scathing letter to the editor criticizing the more recent study6 because it did not take into account a proposed “catch-up comparison involving the MMR vaccine.”7 The letter contained a graph showing the number of cases of autism in California from 1960–1990 based on data provided in a California report from the Office of Development Services (http://www.das. ca.gov). ;;
The authors found no correlation between the increasing incidence of autism with each successive birth cohort and the proportion of children who received MMR vaccination, which was approximately 95% for all boys in each consecutive birth cohort. These results, based on cumulative incidence in consecutive cohorts, provide conclusive evidence that the MMR vaccine could not have caused the dramatic rise in incidence of autism in the GPRD population studied, as proposed in 1988.5 
In a subsequent paper based on the same 106 boys,10 a group of authors sent for the original case records evaluated in the birth cohort analysis discussed above.8 ;;
The authors concluded that there was strong evidence against the proposition that gastrointestinal disorders played a material role in the rising incidence of diagnosed autism in this population of boys. None of the cases involved a diagnosed illness similar to that described earlier.4, 5

Studies published since the Institue of Medicine report have continued not to find an increased risk of autistic spectrum disorder associated with measles–mumps–rubella. The vaccine also has not been found to be associated with a unique syndrome of developmental regression and gastrointestinal disorders. The evidence now is convincing that the measles–mumps–rubella vaccine does not cause autism or any particular subtypes of autistic spectrum disorder.

",introduction;;,"The publication in 1998 of an hypothesis that the measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccine may cause autism as a result of persistent mea- sles virus infection of the gastrointestinal tract [1] generated much concern among parents, particularly those who have children with autism.

","Health scares are characterized by mass media reporting that generates panic about a particular health issue or intervention, and those involved often require information. This article describes a study that aimed to examine the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination scare, its impact on parents of young children, and its effect on their need for information. Seventeen semi-structured interviews were carried out with parents in Sheffield, UK. Analysis of the interview transcripts revealed several categories including the one presented in this article, ‘Information and the MMR vaccine’. The health scare increased parents’ information needs in relation to their decision whether to have their child vaccinated. Parents viewed traditional sources of information critically as they did not consider them to be trustworthy. Parents considered trustworthiness of the information source to be an important factor. Ongoing work in this area is investigating these issues through a large-scale, quantitative study.

This support was for a variety of reasons. A number of the parents interviewed had accessed the research undertaken by Wakefield et al.

Conclusion;;","This will be done by drawing on the documents of the BSE Inquiry and concentrating on what one counsellor called ‘an- other side of the [BSE] story’—that is, the story about the safety of medicines and vaccines, as opposed to the safety of food. By tracing the connections between the two discourses in this way, it is possible to inform the MMR vaccine debate by showing that concern about the MMR vaccine did not begin in 1998 with the publication of the now controversial paper by Wakefield et al. It began a decade earlier, when the British government was grappling with the dual task of promoting its MMR vaccine campaign from October 1988 and trying to prevent the transmission of BSE. ;;
Within the context of the MMR debate, this call was made by the editor of Lancet in 1998 following the publication of the Wakefield et al. paper which speculated on a possible association between the vaccine, autism-like disorders and inflammatory bowel disorders. This paper evoked much criticism from Public Health officials and others, mainly because the case relied on anecdotal evidence (see Payne and Mason, 1998; Lindley and Milla, 1998; O’Brien et al., 1998; Lee et al., 1998; Bedford et al., 1998; Beale, 1998; and Black et al., 1998 for a range of criticisms). ;;
Japanese data shows that one in 400 vaccinees experienced meningitis or meningo-en- cephalitis associated with Urabe strain (Hilleman, 1992). I am not suggesting that this mumps strain of the MMR vaccine is responsible for the autism-like disorders and bowel problems identified in the Wakefield et al. paper, although this is a possibility for others to judge. The point is that a new vaccine was being produced in January 1990 and the discussion at the BSE working group meetings revolved around preventing the transmission of BSE-infected ma- terial through MMR as well as other vaccines. ;;
My concern here has been whether the public should have been informed about any uncertainty at the time. My argument is that it is preferable to rock the boat little by little, in order to prevent it from overturning completely in the future, even though this means being far more open with the public about potential vaccine associated problems and allowing space for the publication of anecdotal reports about vaccine associated effects, such as the one by Wakefield et al. in 1998 that provoked so much criticism. 
Critics argue that the 1998 paper contributed to the scare over the MMR vaccine. ","discusses;;

We report on the validity of the computerized diagnoses of autism in a large case-control study investigating the possible association between autism and the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in the UK using the General Practitioner Research Database (GPRD). We examined anonymized copies of all relevant available clinical reports, including general practitioners' (GP) notes, consultant, speech therapy and educational psychologists reports, on 318 subjects born between 1973 and 1997 with a diagnosis of autism or a related disorder recorded in their electronic general practice record.
Methods
Data were abstracted to a case validation form allowing for the identification of developmental symptoms relevant to the diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). Information on other background clinical and familial features was also abstracted. A subset of 50 notes was coded independently by 2 raters to derive reliability estimates for key clinical characteristics.
Results
For 294 subjects (92.5%) the diagnosis of PDD was confirmed after review of the records. Of these, 180 subjects (61.2%) fulfilled criteria for autistic disorder. The mean age at first recording of a PDD diagnosis in the GPRD database was 6.3 years (SD = 4.6). Consistent with previous estimates, the proportion of subjects experiencing regression in the course of their development was 19%. Inter-rater reliability for the presence of a PDD diagnosis was good (kappa = .73), and agreement on clinical features such as regression, age of parental recognition of first symptoms, language delay and presence of epilepsy was also good (kappas ranging from .56 to 1.0).
Conclusions
This study provides evidence that the positive predictive value of a diagnosis of autism recorded in the GPRD is high.
",Background;;," Improved operationalisation of diagnostic definitions within nosographies has occurred (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; World Health Organization, 1992), in parallel with the development of more precise diagnostic instruments such as the Autism Diagnostic Interview [2] and the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule [3]. There has also been an increasing concern by the public about this group of disorders, prompted, in part, by concern that the rates of PDD may have increased in recent decades [4–6]; and that the cause of the increase may be due to the side effects of vaccination [7–9] or increased exposure of young infants to neurotoxins such as methylmercury or thimerosal [10].

","Background: Immunization programmes are ethically defensible and society has a significant role to play in providing vaccination against measles and safeguarding herd immunity to optimize its individuals’ capabilities. Since preventive actions interfere with individuals who consider themselves as healthy, public health strategies – as distinct from advice in a clinical consultation – require something approaching certainty as to benefits and possible side effects of an intervention. The principle of individual autonomy, a fundamental value in bioethics, often makes discussions covering ethical issues in public health interventions difficult and non-productive as to practical solutions. In encounters intended to provide information on vaccination, discussions regarding risks tend to simplify the issue into an individual one: either the child gets measles or not, or is affected by side effects or not. Method and conclusions: A model is suggested for identification and analysis of the ethical conflicts in measles vaccination programmes, which contains two different dimensions: the affected persons and the relevant ethical principles. Justice as solidarity, not utility, should be paired with autonomy in ethical deliberations on preventive health interventions such as a vaccination programme for measles. If the goal is solidarity rather than conformity, the parents must be free to decide what they think is right, because that is what moral responsibility is all about. Solidarity, however, could never be accepted as an argument without parents trusting the messages from the health institutions and availability of reasonable societal support for those who claim an association between vaccinations and possible side effects.

Particularly after a case series12 concerning measles–mumps–rubella vaccine (MMR), autism, and gastrointestinal symptoms received wide publicity, the public became concerned about a possible link. Understanding people’s mental models13 of autism, that is, their existing understanding and prior beliefs about vaccines and autism, might help to improve communication about vaccines among vaccine providers, policy makers, and parents/patients.;;
For open-ended questions such as, “What made you think that ______’s symptoms might be related to a vaccination?” the most frequent answers were summarized by category (newspaper article, family/friends, Web site), and the remainder were independently reviewed by 2 of the authors (A. B. and E. J. W.).
To assess whether report or reporter characteristics changed after the promulgation of news relating to autism and vaccines, we analyzed data by the date that VAERS reports were received. The highly publicized case series about vaccines and autism was published in February 1998.12 In July 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the US Public Health Service recommended that manufacturers remove or reduce thimerosal in vaccines.11 Two separate date stratifications—1 with March 1, 1998, as a cutoff and 1 with August 1, 1999, as a cutoff—were performed.;;
Other potential influences are less important in the respondents’ minds. Nevertheless, the media clearly played an influential role.
Approximately three quarters of the VAERS reports were received after the original case series was published,12 and two thirds were received after the AAP/US Public Health Service’s thimerosal recommendation.11 Respondents whose reports were received after the original case series was published were more likely than earlier reporters to cite the MMR vaccine as a contributing factor.;;
Respondents whose reports were received after the original case series was published were more likely than earlier reporters to cite the MMR vaccine as a contributing factor. One respondent specifically mentioned the Wakefield case series12 as a reason to attribute her child’s symptoms to a vaccine; her VAERS report, which was received 2 years after the article was published, listed MMR as the sole vaccine. Lingam et al. reported that parents who had observed regression in their autistic children—rather than delayed development—were more likely to speculate about the MMR vaccine and other possible causes of autism.17;;","credits;;

","The mechanisms behind autoimmune reaction to nervous system antigens in autism are not understood. We assessed the reactivity of sera from 50 autism patients and 50 healthy controls to specific peptides from gliadin and the cerebellum. A significant percentage of autism patients showed elevations in antibodies against gliadin and cerebellar peptides simultaneously. For examining cross-reaction between dietary proteins and cerebellar antigens, antibodies were prepared in rabbits, and binding of rabbit anti-gliadin, anti-cerebellar peptides, anti-MBP, anti-milk, anti-egg, anti-soy and anti-corn to either gliadin- or cerebellar-antigen-coated wells was measured. In comparison to anti-gliadin peptide binding to gliadin peptide at 100%, the reaction of anti-cerebellar peptide to gliadin peptide was 22%, whereas the binding of anti-myelin basic protein (MBP), anti-milk, anti-egg and anti-soy to gliadin was less than 10%. Further examination of rabbit anti-gliadin (EQVPLVQQ) and anti-cerebellar (EDVPLLED) 8 amino acid (AA) peptides with human serum albumin (HSA) and an unrelated peptide showed no binding, but the reaction of these antibodies with both the cerebellar and gliadin peptides was greater than 60%.

This article looks at the evidence for a link between MMR and autism, finding that while a plausible hypothesis has been constructed, there is no substantive evidence for such a link and that the quality of this evidence is, in many cases, poor.

The controversy was brought to the forefront following a 1998 case series report in which the authors hypothesized a “unique disease process” of bowel abnormalities and autism in a small group of children who had received MMR immunization.2 The authors hypothesized that the MMR vaccine causes inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, producing a leaky bowel that allows for the circulation of neurotoxins that can cause central nervous system damage and developmental regression.3;;
The studies reviewed here sought to evaluate whether a causal relationship can be determined between administration of MMR vaccine and the development of autism. In the first of these investigations, Wakefield et al.2 submitted a case series report of 12 children between 3 and 11 years of age who were referred to a pediatric gastroenterology clinic with symptoms of enterocolitis and a history of normal development followed by a loss of acquired skills. All children underwent gastrointestinal, neurologic, and behavioral assessment.;;
Although the authors were unable to demonstrate an association between autism and MMR vaccine, the findings sparked suspicion regarding the safety of the vaccine in both the general public and the medical community.
Following the Wakefield et al.2 report, another group conducted a cross-sectional epidemiologic study to evaluate whether the MMR vaccine could be causally associated with autism.9 Four hundred ninety-eight autistic children born between 1979 and 1998 were identified using the special needs and disability registers of North East Thames, UK. A time-trend analysis was performed to evaluate whether there was a change in the incidence of autism after the addition of the MMR vaccine to the immunization schedule.;;
Since the number of children with autism continued to increase, the investigators concluded that administration of MMR vaccine was not linked to the development of autism.
Taylor et al.16 conducted a follow-up population study to investigate whether administration of MMR vaccine was associated with bowel problems and developmental regression in children with autism, as was hypothesized by Wakefield et al.2 Autistic children born from 1979 to 1998 were identified using the special needs and disability registers of North East Thames, UK.

Published studies during the past year about three topics important to the pediatric clinician—- immunizations, neonatal jaundice, and animal-induced injuries—are concisely reviewed.
Recent findings 
Recent updates regarding vaccines including the questionable link with autism, implementation of universal influenza vaccination for young children, the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccine against invasive disease, and new information on pertussis, varicella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, measles, and rotavirus vaccination are discussed. No association between measles/mumps/rubella vaccine or thimerosal-containing pertussis vaccine and autism is evident. Universal influenza vaccination for children 6 to 23 months of age will be recommended for the 2004–2005 flu season, and this implementation should reduce significant school absenteeism as well as complications seen last year including encephalopathy, seizures, respiratory failure, and pneumonia. Pneumococcal vaccine significantly reduces rates of invasive pneumococcal vaccine in healthy and HIV-infected children, although it does not appear to greatly affect otitis media rates. A reduction in post-vaccine febrile seizures appears to be present since the introduction of acellular pertussis vaccine. Multiple outbreaks in varicella have been reported since the introduction of the varicella vaccine, and a booster vaccination may be necessary in the future. Methods for detecting and preventing severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia are reviewed, as well as anticipated recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics for the detection and management of hyperbilirubinemia. High bilirubin levels in preterm infants may result in hearing dysfunction and developmental impairment. The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended a higher level of monitoring for newborn jaundice and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in an effort to prevent kernicterus and sequelae from elevated bilirubin levels, including post-discharge follow-up appointment by day 3 to 5 of age. Dog bites in children with resultant post-traumatic stress disorder, rabies, and salmonellosis from pet reptiles in the home are also addressed. Clinicians need to be aware of the risk for rabies bites, need to recognize that dog bites in children appear to cause post-traumatic stress disorder in more than half of cases, and need to know how to educate patients on how to prevent salmonellosis from pet reptiles and amphibians.
Summary 
Progress has been made in immunizations, especially immunization for influenza, pneumonia, and pertussis. It is recommended that monitoring for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia be more thorough to prevent the consequences of this condition. Rabies, post-traumatic stress disorder from dog bites, and salmonellosis associated with pet reptiles constitute an important area for patient education.",First section; “IMMUNIZATIONS”;;,"The proposed link between vaccines and the development of autism has generated tremendous controversy, especially since the appearance of a provocative article in 1998 by Wakefield et al. [1].

","Clinical and subclinical seizures occur frequently among children with autistic spectrum disorders. Electrographic status epilepticus in sleep, or continuous spike-wave in slow-wave sleep, is a typical feature of acquired epileptic aphasia and Landau-Kleffner syndrome. Seizures and epilepsy are more common among children with autistic spectrum disorder who experience language regression, especially those who experience language regression after the age of 2 years. Although the seizures associated with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and with acquired epileptic aphasia can be easily treated, improvement in language function often does not follow successful treatment of seizures. There are no published randomized clinical trials of treatments for Landau-Kleffner syndrome or for autistic language regression. Broad-spectrum antiepileptic drugs not associated with cognitive slowing are probably the treatment of choice for epilepsy among children with autistic spectrum disorder. Large multisite trials are needed to determine treatment efficacy among children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and acquired epileptic aphasia and to establish whether there is a cause-effect relationship between electrographic status epilepticus in sleep or continuous spike-wave in slow-wave sleep and autistic language regression.

","Increases in the reported prevalence of autism and autistic spectrum disorders in recent years have fueled concern over possible environmental causes. The author reviews the available survey literature and finds evidence of large increases in prevalence in both the United States and the United Kingdom that cannot be explained by changes in diagnostic criteria or improvements in case ascertainment. Incomplete ascertainment of autism cases in young child populations is the largest source of predictable bias in prevalence surveys; however, this bias has, if anything, worked against the detection of an upward trend in recent surveys. Comparison of autism rates by year of birth for specific geographies provides the strongest basis for trend assessment. Such comparisons show large recent increases in rates of autism and autistic spectrum disorders in both the U.S. and the U.K. Reported rates of autism in the United States increased from <3 per 10,000 children in the 1970s to >30 per 10,000 children in the 1990s, a 10-fold increase. In the United Kingdom, autism rates rose from <10 per 10,000 in the 1980s to roughly 30 per 10,000 in the 1990s. Reported rates for the full spectrum of autistic disorders rose from the 5 to 10 per 10,000 range to the 50 to 80 per 10,000 range in the two countries. A precautionary approach suggests that the rising incidence of autism should be a matter of urgent public concern.

","Objective: Determine the effect of a moderate dose multivitamin/mineral supplement on children with autistic spectrum disorder.
Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-month study.
Subjects: Twenty (20) children with autistic spectrum disorder, ages 3–8 years.
Results: A Global Impressions parental questionnaire found that the supplement group reported statistically significant improvements in sleep and gastrointestinal problems compared to the placebo group. An evaluation of vitamin B6 levels prior to the study found that the autistic children had substantially elevated levels of B6 compared to a control group of typical children (75% higher, p < 0.0000001). Vitamin C levels were measured at the end of the study, and the placebo group had levels that were significantly below average for typical children, whereas the supplement group had near-average levels.
Discussion: The finding of high vitamin B6 levels is consistent with recent reports of low levels of pyridoxal-5-phosphate and low activity of pyridoxal kinase (i.e., pyridoxal is only poorly converted to pyridoxal- 5-phosphate, the enzymatically active form). This may explain the functional need for high-dose vitamin B6 supplementation in many children and adults with autism.

B12 deficiency 
A functional B12 deficiency has been suggested by a study that found elevated urinary methylmalonic acid in autistics (Wakefield et al., 1998). 
Calcium deficiency Landgreme found that 22% of autistic children measured low 24-hour urinary calcium excretion (Landgreme and Landgrebe, 1976). ;;",cites for information;;,neutral;;,no;;,
