The suggestion that measles infection is causally linked to Crohn's disease had been disproved already6 but there has since been a decrease in MMR vaccination uptake with the potential for future morbidity. 7 The basis for the early report was 12 children whose parents had reported the onset of bowel disease and autism soon after MMR vaccination. 5The age when these conditions first appear however, is also the age for MMR vaccination. ;;
The publication of the 'early report' based on only 12 patients resulted in a prodigious correspondence which canvassed the rift which can exist between clinical medicine and public health, 12 and the inadequacy of evidence related to problems of methodology. 11-21 The controversy in that correspondence was whether or not the paper byWakefield5 should have been accepted for publication. It attracted mass media attention and generated considerable public concern despite the lack of evidence linking MMR vaccination with the conditions suffered by the 12 children. ;;","discusses;;

however, indicate the need for further investigation into the possible links
between the autistic syndrome and the prevalence of physiological factors.
Speculation about a possible interplay between autism and various
biochemical systems of the body, such as the immune system (Warren et
al., 1996; Van Gent et al., 1997; Wakeﬁeld et al., 1998), suggests that
speciﬁc behaviours associated with the autistic syndrome could also be
accompanied by speciﬁc physiological problems associated with affected
systems of the body. The ﬁndings that nearly two-thirds of Children
showed a history of eczema or similar skin complaints, and over a quarter
had problems with asthma—related conditions (both exceeding the general
population incidence ﬁgures), imply the involvement of the immune
system in some fashion.;;

1996), which has also been associated with subsequent physiological
difﬁculties such as problems with intestinal permeability (Waring and

between parental and sibling health problems (especially related to
problems of the immune system) and the presence of physiological
symptoms coexisting with the overt diagnostic deﬁnition of autism
supports the View of autism being an organic disorder, either immuno—
logical or metabolic (Shattock and Savery, 1996 ; Wakeﬁeld et al., 1998),

The passage of elevated levels of peptides through to the CNS is further aided by gastrointestinal conditions indicative of an abnormally porous intestinal membrane (Waring and Ngong, 1993; Gardner, 1994; D’Eufemia et al., 1996; Wakefield et al., 1998).

Increased urine secretion of peptides has been found in celiac disease, probably resulting from increased intestinal uptake of peptides caused by damage to the small gut mucosa.
Methods:
High-performance liquid chromatography of low-molecular-weight peptides in the urine was performed over 6 months, before and after a gluten-free diet was instituted in children who clinically improved while consuming the diet.
Results:
A significant decrease of peptide levels was observed in children consuming the gluten-free diet. Certain peptide peaks thought to be gluten related decreased the most after the patients began the diet.

Although standard medical treatment is often helpful, the under- lying causes of these disorders are not well understood. Furthermore, some individuals respond poorly or not at all to regular medicine. Evidence is accumulating in the medical literature that the enteric nervous system (ENS)—that part of the nervous system associated with the alimen- tary canal—also plays a role in these disorders. Historically, the concept of an autonomous ab- dominal nervous system was advocated by Byron Robinson, Johannis Langley, and Edgar Cayce.

The rapid increase in research endeavour has not kept pace with the advent of well-publicised theories and treatments for autism.
Aims
To explore some of the newer developments in biological research into autism.
Method
A review of recent publications and presentations.
Results
The concept is shifting from the narrow perception of aloof autism, described by Kanner, to a wider one that includes a spectrum extending to a broader, subclinical phenotype. The genetic basis has been established; now we need to discover the location and interaction of the relevant sites. There is considerable interest in the bowel as a pathogenetic agent, particularly in the effects of exogenous opioids and multiple viral infection (the latter posing a public health problem). Also of concern is the role of (potentially treatable) epilepsy, analogous to the Laudau-Kleffner syndrome.
Conclusions
In the absence of a cure, the implementation of ideas will continue to outstrip factual evidence. Clinicians are challenged by the availability of information (and misinformation), particularly on the internet.

Design: Open, uncontrolled trial. Materials and Methods: Sixty-four patients were registered for the study. They included 3 female adults and 2 male adolescents. There was a total of 16 dropouts. Thus there were 48 evaluable patients. Each patient received a complete vial of secretin, irrespective of current age and body weight. Any existing treatment that had already been started before the study began was allowed to continue. No new treatment was permitted for a minimum period of 8 weeks when study surveillance was completed. The parents or guardians performed clinical assessment on a weekly basis, using numerical scoring of symptoms in a questionnaire. The only laboratory study performed was a hair analysis at the outset and at the completion of the 8 weeks of surveillance. Results: Of 48 evaluable patients, there were 39 whose clinical response varied from minor to major behavioral and/or bowel function improvement and 9 in whom there was no sign at all of either a behavioral or gastrointestinal response. Only a few of these patients showed significant abnormalities in hair analysis and there was no significant difference in these changes as compared with a group of children who had been seen at our clinic for reasons other than autistic spectrum. The side effects observed were temporary irritability in a few patients and exacerbation of previously quiescent seizures in one child. Conclusions: We found a clearcut population of clinical ''responders'' as compared with a much smaller group of ''non-responders.'' Little can be said about the dropout patients other than to conclude that total lack of response and expense were the most likely causes. We can certainly encourage and condone the use of secretin as a valuable weapon in attempting treatment of this devastating spectrum of disease. This study has not helped to define the indications to suggest a ''responder'' from a ''non-responder.''

Post-mortem studies on small case series report cellular abnormalities in the limbic system and cerebellum. Between 10 and 20% of subjects with autism have macrocephalia, which is in accordance with MRI findings of an increased total brain tissue volume and enlargement most prominent in the occipital and parietal lobes.

","OBJECTIVE:
Intestinal pathology, i.e., ileocolonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) and mucosal inflammation, has been described in children with developmental disorders. This study describes some of the endoscopic and pathological characteristics in a group of children with developmental disorders (affected children) that are associated with behavioral regression and bowel symptoms, and compares them with pediatric controls.
METHODS:
Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy were performed on 60 affected children (median age 6 yr, range 3–16; 53 male). Developmental diagnoses were autism (50 patients), Asperger's syndrome (five), disintegrative disorder (two), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (one), schizophrenia (one), and dyslexia (one). Severity of ileal LNH was graded (0–3) in both affected children and 37 developmentally normal controls (median age 11 yr, range 2–13 yr) who were investigated for possible inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Tissue sections were reviewed by three pathologists and scored on a standard proforma. Data were compared with ileocolonic biopsies from 22 histologically normal children (controls) and 20 children with ulcerative colitis (UC), scored in an identical manner. Gut pathogens were sought routinely.
RESULTS:
Ileal LNH was present in 54 of 58 (93%) affected children and in five of 35 (14.3%) controls (p < 0.001). Colonic LNH was present in 18 of 60 (30%) affected children and in two of 37 (5.4%) controls (p < 0.01). Histologically, reactive follicular hyperplasia was present in 46 of 52 (88.5%) ileal biopsies from affected children and in four of 14 (29%) with UC, but not in non-IBD controls (p < 0.01). Active ileitis was present in four of 51 (8%) affected children but not in controls. Chronic colitis was identified in 53 of 60 (88%) affected children compared with one of 22 (4.5%) controls and in 20 of 20 (100%) with UC. Scores of frequency and severity of inflammation were significantly greater in both affected children and those with UC, compared with controls (p < 0.001).

In these children, the majority of whom had autism, a period of initial normal development was followed by developmental regression and loss of ac- quired skills, sometimes occurring precipitously over a pe- riod of days to weeks. Long-standing intestinal symptoms, as described previously (1), were typical of this group of children. These symptoms had often started at around the same time as the behavioral changes. ;;
In its persistent acquired form, ileal LNH has been reported in association with infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) before the development of AIDS (10). 
The other consistent feature of the intestinal lesion was a mild-to-moderate colitis that lacked the specific diagnostic features of either Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis (1). This combination of features, i.e., LNH and nonspecific colitis, indicates the possibility of chronic mucosal and/or systemic immune dysregulation. ;;
These immune changes, plus the presence of myelin basic protein (MBP) antibodies (15) and inhibition of macrophage migration to MBP (16), have led some workers to suggest that the behavioural syndrome may be associated with cerebral damage due to an autoimmune response to myelin or other structural compo- nents of the CNS (15, 16). As part of our initial study (1) we undertook cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, EEG, and biochemical analysis of cerebrospinal fluid; none of these investigations indicated cerebral inflammation that would be consistent with autoimmune demyelination, although a more subtle lesion remains a possibility. Alternatively, oth- ers have proposed that some forms of autism may arise from the toxic effects of intestinal products on the developing brain (17–19), a situation that may have some overlap with hepatic enephalopathy. ;;
This study involved the analysis of data from 60 consecutive children with developmental disorders (affected children) including those 12 children described in a preliminary report (1). The median age of the children was 6 yr (range 3–16 yr) and 53 were boys, consistent with the male bias of devel- opmental disorders (20). ;;
All clinical investigations were undertaken with fully in- formed, written consent from the parents. The initial phase of these studies (1) was approved by the Ethical Practices Committee of the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust. There- after, children were investigated according to clinical need after a formal referral from each child’s General Practitioner or Consultant. ;;
LNH (not graded), red halo sign surrounding follicles (21), loss of vascular pattern, mucosal granularity, mucosal erythema, and presence of ulcer(s). These features, which are recognized correlates of associ- ated histopathological abnormality, were noted previously to be characteristic of this patient group (1). These features were recorded both for cases and for non-IBD controls; the data are shown in Figure 3. ;;
The differences between biopsies from affected children and from both non-IBD controls and those with ulcerative colitis are significant (p 􏰌 0.001 and p 􏰌 0.01, respectively). Qualitatively, ileal lymph nodes in those children with LNH showed marked expansion of lymphoid tissue in histological section, as described previously (1). Follicle numbers per biopsy were increased from 2–3 follicles per biopsy in normal ileal biopsies to 4–5 per biopsy in those with LNH: follicles were confluent with loss of follicle-to-follicle de- marcation. ;;
These data both confirm and extend our original observa- tions (1), and indicate a subtle and consistent pattern of intestinal pathology in this cohort of consecutively referred children. The combination of ileocolonic LNH and colitis in children with developmental disorders distinguished them from developmentally normal children with similar symp- toms (including abdominal pain and constipation) in whom LNH and histopathological change were uncommon. ;;

Several disorders have been attributed to measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination during the past decade. The aim of this prospective follow-up study was to identify serious adverse events causally related to MMR vaccination.
Methods.
When the MMR vaccination program was launched in Finland in 1982, a countrywide surveillance system was set up to detect serious adverse events associated with MMR. To obtain detailed case histories vaccinees’ clinical charts were reviewed. Serum samples were analyzed to trace concurrent infections.
Setting.
All hospitals and health centers in Finland from 1982 through 1996.
Results.
Immunization of 1.8 million individuals and consumption of almost 3 million vaccine doses by the end of 1996 gave rise to 173 potentially serious reactions claimed to have been caused by MMR vaccination. In all, 77 neurologic, 73 allergic and 22 miscellaneous reactions and 1 death were reported, febrile seizure being the most common event. However, 45% of these events proved to be probably caused or contributed by some other factor, giving an incidence of serious adverse events with possible or indeterminate causal relation with MMR vaccination of 5.3 per 100 000 vaccinees or 3.2 per 100 000 vaccine doses.
Conclusions.
Causality between immunization and a subsequent untoward event cannot be estimated solely on the basis of a temporal relation. Comprehensive analysis of the reported adverse reactions established that serious events causally related to MMR vaccine are rare and greatly outweighed by the risks of natural MMR diseases.",Final section; “Discussion”;;,"No case of inflammatory bowel disease or autism was detected during this long follow-up study comprising 3 million vaccine doses.

However, children still die from complications of treatment and these are potentially preventable. We have analysed data from three large consecutive national protocols for ALL from 1980 to 1997 [Medical Research Council United Kingdom ALL (MRC UKALL) trials VIII, X and XI] to compare the incidence and causes of treatment‐related deaths (TRD). The percentage of TRD has fallen from 9% to 2% (UKALL VIII to XI), largely as a result of a decrease in fatal infections. Deaths during induction have fallen from 3% to 1%, the main causes of death being bacterial, followed by fungal infection, while other causes, chiefly haemorrhage, have not declined. Remission deaths also decreased from 6% to 1%, particularly those deaths due to measles and pneumocystis carinii. More guidelines for surveillance and treatment of infections have been included within progressively more intensive protocols. Risk factor analysis showed increased TRD in patients with Down's syndrome, high leucocyte count and older age in UKALL XI. In contrast, the introduction of blocks of intensification was not associated with an increased death rate. While improved supportive care has reduced the incidence of TRD, there is still scope for further reduction by prompt treatment of suspected infection. Maintenance of herd immunity remains of vital importance in avoiding deaths from measles.


",Final section; “Discussion”;;,"MRC UKALL VIII was associated with a significant number of fatal pneumonitis episodes (Darbyshire et al, 1985) and the introduction of routine prophylaxis with oral cotrimoxazole resulted in a reduction in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis, as in other trials. Measles in the immune‐suppressed child causes an interstitial pneumonitis for which there is no effective treatment (Gray et al, 1987; Kernahan et al, 1987) and the introduction of routine childhood measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunization in 1988 has fortunately resulted in the virtual abolition of this devastating complication.

An association between mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccination and the onset of symptoms typical of autism has recently been suggested. This has led to considerable concern about the safety of the vaccine.
Methods
A matched case-control study using data derived form the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database. Children with a possible diagnosis of autism will be identified from their electronic health records. All diagnoses will be validated by a detailed review of hospital letters and by using information derived from a parental questionnaire. Ten controls per case will be selected from the database. Conditional logistic regression will be used to assess the association between MMR vaccination and autism. In addition case series analyses will be undertaken to estimate the relative incidence of onset of autism in defined time intervals after vaccination. The study is funded by the United Kingdom Medical Research Council.

Both tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators can be efficiently inhibited by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a protease inhibitor of the serpin family. The human PAI-1 gene is located on chromosome 7q, within or close to a region that has been linked to autism in several linkage studies. Autism seems to be characterized by altered neuronal cytoarchitecture, synaptogenesis and possibly also cellular immune responses. We began addressing the potential involvement of the PAI-1 gene in autistic disorder with this linkage/association study, assessing transmission patterns of the 4G/5G polymorphism in the PAI-1 gene promoter that was previously shown to significantly affect PAI-1 plasma levels.

The US Vital Statistics offer the opportunity to study causes of death broken down by comorbid disease associations. The aim of this study was to analyze the presence of comorbid condi- tions in persons who died from ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. 
METHODS: The numbers of deaths from ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease were retrieved from the computerized 1991–1996 data files of the National Center for Health Statistics. Comorbid associations between other diagnosis and ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease were expressed as age-, gender-, and race-standardized proportional mortality ratios. 
RESULTS: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease showed, in general, similar patterns of comorbidity. Both diseases were associated with similar sets of GI complications, such as intestinal obstruction and stasis, mucosal inflammation and infection, vascular complications, and complications related to fistula and abscess formation. Extraintestinal complica- tions of both IBD involved disorders of the hepatobiliary system, urinary system, and various coagulopathies. Ulcer- ative colitis alone was found to be associated with Hirsch- sprung’s disease and schizophrenia, whereas Crohn’s dis- ease alone was found to be related with osteoporosis and amyloidosis. 
CONCLUSIONS: No completely unexplained or hitherto un- described association was revealed.

One study suggests that children with autism have a unique inflammatory bowel disorder that is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. The appropriate use of new diagnostic tests and novel treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) needs to be clarified

Because of concerns regarding sensitivity and specificity, serologic markers measuring anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies cannot yet replace conventional diagnostic testing for screening or diagnosis of pediatric IBD. Large, prospective, pediatric population-based studies still need to be performed to ascertain their use as a noninvasive screening tool. Genetic studies using thiopurine methyl transferase and measurement of 6-mercaptopurine metabolites appear to be valuable for management of pediatric patients with IBD, in assisting clinicians in optimizing therapeutic response to 6-mercaptopurine, and in identifying individuals at increased risk for drug-induced toxicity. Newer immunomodulatory agents also are being explored in pediatric IBD. Open pilot trials of infliximab (Remicade; Centocor, Malvern, PA) for the treatment of children with Crohn disease that does not respond to conventional management have demonstrated short-term efficacy and safety.

","Background. Combination vaccines contain multiple antigens to protect against several dis- eases simultaneously and have simplified the delivery of childhood immunizations. Children are healthier today because of the use of combi- nation vaccines, and the United States is benefit- ing from record low numbers of vaccine-prevent- able diseases. Despite obvious benefits, concerns and misconceptions exist regarding the safety and efficacy of combination vaccines. 
Methods. A review of the pediatric literature to dispel the common misperceptions and potential barriers to combining vaccines. 
Results. Assurance that combination vaccines approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration undergo extensive testing will help to alleviate concerns regarding safety and efficacy of combination vaccines. Food and Drug Administration standards are rigorous and re- quire that combination vaccines be as safe and effective as each component of the vaccine ad- ministered separately. Combination vaccines have been available for >50 years, and lessons learned during this time are continuously ap- plied to the development and use of new prod- ucts. 
Conclusions. Children will benefit from new combination vaccines because fewer injections will be required to protect against vaccine- preventable diseases, allowing for the introduc- tion of new vaccines into the immunization schedule and prevention of additional diseases.

2002,10.1002/mrdd.10029,doi.org,The epidemiology of autistic spectrum disorders: is the prevalence rising?,"For decades after Kanner's original paper on the subject was published in 1943, autism was generally considered to be a rare condition with a prevalence of around 2–4 per 10,000 children. Then, studies carried out in the late 1990s and the present century reported annual rises in incidence of autism in pre‐school children, based on age of diagnosis, and increases in the age‐specific prevalence rates in children. Prevalence rates of up to 60 per 10,000 for autism and even more for the whole autistic spectrum were reported. Reasons for these increases are discussed. They include changes in diagnostic criteria, development of the concept of the wide autistic spectrum, different methods used in studies, growing awareness and knowledge among parents and professional workers and the development of specialist services, as well as the possibility of a true increase in numbers. Various environmental causes for a genuine rise in incidence have been suggested, including the triple vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR]. Not one of the possible environmental causes, including MMR, has been confirmed by independent scientific investigation, whereas there is strong evidence that complex genetic factors play a major role in etiology. The evidence suggests that the majority, if not all, of the reported rise in incidence and prevalence is due to changes in diagnostic criteria and increasing awareness and recognition of autistic spectrum disorders. Whether there is also a genuine rise in incidence remains an open question.

Whilst being welcome, this progress to earlier referral and diagnosis presents new challenges to clinical practice, including the accuracy and stability of early diagnosis, the utility of standardised assessment instruments with young pre‐schoolers and the ability to indicate prognosis. Method: A selective review of recent research literature on the characteristic features of ASD in pre‐school children. Results: Multidisciplinary diagnostic assessment should include detailed information on developmental history, parents' descriptions of the everyday behaviour and activities of the child, direct assessment of the child's social interaction style, including where possible with age peers, and formal assessment of communicative, intellectual and adaptive function. Clinical assessments need to concentrate on the identification of impairments in early non‐verbal social communication behaviours that characterise children with ASD from the second year of life, including social orienting, joint attention, imitation, play and reciprocal affective behaviour. The particular pattern of symptoms that presents in a 2‐year‐old with ASD may differ from that seen at the more prototypic age of 4 or 5 years. In particular, overt repetitive and stereotyped behaviours may be less notable, although where these are seen alongside the social and communicative impairments they are highly indicative of ASD. The use of standardised assessment instruments and the strict application of the DSM and ICD diagnostic criteria need to be employed with caution, as an expert clinical view has been shown to be more accurate. An important aspect of early diagnostic consultation is an open and straightforward approach to the negotiation of the diagnostic view with parents over time. Conclusions: Earlier diagnosis and rising recognition of ASD have significant implications for primary healthcare and specialist diagnostic and therapeutic services.

","Autism is a lifelong condition usually described as affecting social, cognitive and imaginative abilities. For many years, parents and some professionals have observed that in concordance with the behavioural and psychological symptoms of the condition, there are a number of physiological and biochemical correlates which may also be of relevance to the syndrome. One area of interest that encompasses many of these observations is the opioid-excess theory of autism. The main premise of this theory is that autism is the result of a metabolic disorder. Peptides with opioid activity derived from dietary sources, in particular foods that contain gluten and casein, pass through an abnormally permeable intestinal membrane and enter the central nervous system (CNS) to exert an effect on neurotransmission, as well as producing other physiologically-based symptoms. Numerous parents and professionals worldwide have found that removal of these exogenously derived compounds through exclusion diets can produce some amelioration in autistic and related behaviours. There is a surprisingly long history of research accompanying these ideas. The aim of this paper is to review the accompanying evidence in support of this theory and present new directions of intervention as a result of it.",middle section;“Opioid-excess theory of autism ”;;,"The significance of gastrointestinal disturbances associated with autism has also begun to receive attention in research literature [40].

More controversially, it is suggested that persistent measles infections that result from the com- bined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine may trigger autism by causing intestinal permeability in a subgroup of children who develop symptoms of autism within a short period of receiving the vaccine.

","We have reported lymphocytic colitis in children with regressive autism, with epithelial damage prominent. We now compare duodenal biopsies in 25 children with regressive autism to 11 with coeliac disease, five with cerebral palsy and mental retardation and 18 histologically normal controls. Immunohistochemistry was performed for lymphocyte and epithelial lineage and functional markers. We determined the density of intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocyte populations, and studied mucosal immunoglobulin and complement C1q localisation. Standard histopathology showed increased enterocyte and Paneth cell numbers in the autistic children. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased lymphocyte infiltration in both epithelium and lamina propria with upregulated crypt cell proliferation, compared to normal and cerebral palsy controls. Intraepithelial lymphocytes and lamina propria plasma cells were lower than in coeliac disease, but lamina propria T cell populations were higher and crypt proliferation similar. Most strikingly, IgG deposition was seen on the basolateral epithelial surface in 23/25 autistic children, co-localising with complement C1q. This was not seen in the other conditions. These findings demonstrate a novel form of enteropathy in autistic children, in which increases in mucosal lymphocyte density and crypt cell proliferation occur with epithelial IgG deposition.

In addition to frequent gastrointestinal symptoms, children with autism often manifest complex biochemical and immunological abnormalities. The gut–brain axis is central to certain encephalopathies of extra‐cranial origin, hepatic encephalopathy being the best characterized.
Commonalities in the clinical characteristics of hepatic encephalopathy and a form of autism associated with developmental regression in an apparently previously normal child, accompanied by immune‐mediated gastrointestinal pathology, have led to the proposal that there may be analogous mechanisms of toxic encephalopathy in patients with liver failure and some children with autism. Aberrations in opioid biochemistry are common to these two conditions, and there is evidence that opioid peptides may mediate certain aspects of the respective syndromes. The generation of plausible and testable hypotheses in this area may help to identify new treatment options in encephalopathies of extra‐cranial origin.
Therapeutic targets for this autistic phenotype may include: modification of diet and entero‐colonic microbial milieu in order to reduce toxin substrates, improve nutritional status and modify mucosal immunity; anti‐inflammatory/immunomodulatory therapy; and specific treatment of dysmotility, focusing, for example, on the pharmacology of local opioid activity in the gut.","middle section;“THE GUT IN AUTISM: CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND SUBCLINICAL DISEASE”;;

Better at times to be vaguely right, we argue, rather than precisely wrong.

It is not the intention of this article to either refute or substantiate the ongoing controversy, as this is obviously a scientific debate, butrather to offer an overview of the studies to date in the interest ofhelping practitioners in the frontline to engage in informed debate with concerned parents. The conclusions from this review stem from twomajor studies conducted by the Institute of Medicine (IoM, 2001) in theUSA, and the Medical Research Council (MRC, 2001) in the UK. Both conclude that although epidemiological studies so far do notsupport a link between MMR and autism, nonetheless the studies havebeen too imprecise to rule out the prospect of the vaccination beinginvolved in a small number of cases, and the need for further researchhas been pointed out.","middle section;“WAKEFIELD ET AL’S (1998) STUDY ”;;

Conclusion;;","Wakefield et al’s (1998) study is generally credited with initiating the MMR vaccine con- troversy. The study describes how a total of 12 children, 11 boys and 1 girl aged between 3 and 10 years, with a mean age of 6 years, were referred to the gastroenterology unit at the Royal Free Hospital, London, with a history of normal development followed by a loss of acquired skills, including language, together with diarrhoea and abdominal pain. ;;
Nine were diagnosed as autistic, one with degenerative psychosis and two with possible postviral or vaccinal encephalitis. The authors concluded: 
‘We did not find an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described’ (Wakefield et al, 1998). 
Although they stated that they did not find a link they postulated that MMR leads to a non-specific gut condition, ‘leaky gut syn- drome’, permitting the absorption of non-per- meable peptides, including vaccines. ;;
Kastner and Gellin (2001) acknowledge that such a ‘leak’ may be plausible but questioned why this ‘leak’ would be in one direction only or so specific as to permit the passage of some molecules but not other similar ones. Following Wakefield et al’s (1998) allega- tions, there have been many studies investi- gating a possible link between MMR and autism, all of which have rejected a causal link. These studies include Peltola et al (1998), Gillberg and Heijbel (1998), Taylor et al (1999), Patja et al (2000), Fombonne and Chakrabarti (2001), and Kaye et al (2001). ;;
The parents of these children claim that MMR was the trigger. 
Wakefield et al (1998) have suggested one mode of action by which the MMR vaccine can trigger autism, i.e. the gastrointestinal route, although the exact mechanism is unclear. ;;
Despite the voluminous reports, publicity, anec- dotal evidence and debate that Wakefield et al’s (1998) report has generated over the past 4 years, and the overwhelming scientific opin- ion that argues against a link between MMR vaccine and ASD, the controversy continues. This leads to considerable unease in the prac- tice situation because the evidence does not support a link and therefore the DoH continues to promote MMR uptake, although this task can prove difficult when such controversy sur- rounds the issue.

","Public tolerance to adverse reactions is minimal. Several reporting systems have been established to monitor adverse events following immunization. The present review summarizes data on neurologic complications following vaccination, and provides evidence that indicates whether they were directly associated with the vaccines. These complications include autism (measles vaccine), multiple sclerosis (hepatitis B vaccine), meningoencephalitis (Japanese encephalitis vaccine), Guillain-Barre syndrome and giant cell arteritis (influenza vaccine), and reactions after exposure to animal rabies vaccine. Seizures and hypotonic/hyporesponsive episodes following pertussis vaccination and potential risks associated with varicella vaccination, as well as vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis following oral poliovirus vaccination, are also described.

Some element of risk was accepted as inevitable withinlife. The three ethnic groups had different exposure to media publicityabout the risks of MMR, largely linked to command of English. Pakistaniwomen believed that health professionals gave them the best advice aboutchildhood immunisation, but Afro-Caribbean and Somali womenexpressed a desire for more information from health professionals,particularly written information about immunisation which is inclusiveof Black people and available in translation.Conclusions This small qualitative study suggests that ethnic minorityparents perceive the benefits of childhood immunisation as greatlyoutweighing the risks.

","The prevalence of childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD) is unknown. In this study, 32 epidemiological surveys of autism and pervasive developmental disorders published in English language journals since 1966 were reviewed. Four surveys yielded estimates for CDD ranging from 1.1 to 6.4 per 100,000 subjects. A pooled estimate across these four surveys is 1.7 per 100,000 (95 percent Confidence Interval: 0.6-3.8 per 100,000).

The importance of differentiating CDD from autism is illustrated by recent reports of patterns of regression in the developmental course of children with pervasive developmental disorders possibly linked to measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) immunization (Wakefield et al., 1998; 2000). Although the precise clinical phenotype of this putative variant of autism has not been described with adequate precision (Fombonne and Chakrabarti, 2001), almost all these children are reported to have shown regression in their development after a period of presumably normal development (Wakefield et al., 2000).

Two participants would not rule out that the MMR immunization might be the causation for their children’s disabilities. Wakefield et al.’s (1998) study supporting this link focused on anecdotal evidence; however, the authors performed no scientific analyses to substantiate their theory. In at least four of the 12 cases reported in the study, behavioural problems appeared before the onset of symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease: that is, the effect preceded the proposed cause. ;;

","In 1998, a report was published describing 12 patients with inflammatory bowel conditions and regressive developmental disorders consisting primarily of autism. The authors hypothesised that MMR vaccine may have been responsible for the bowel dysfunction which subsequently resulted in the neurodevelopmental disorders. The suggestion that measles vaccine may cause autism through a persistent bowel infection generated much interest since it provided a possible biological mechanism for a causal association. Epidemiological studies, however, have not found an association between MMR vaccination and autism. Autism has a strong genetic component and its associated neurological defects probably occur during embryonic development. It seems unlikely that a vaccination that is given after birth could cause autism. In a minority of cases, autism may have onset after 1 year of age (regressive autism) but the one epidemiological study that included such cases did not find an association with MMR vaccination. Currently, the weight of the available epidemiological and related evidence does not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism.

In a minority of cases, however, a child can appear to be developing completely normally but then regresses and develops autistic characteristics. It is such cases of regressive disorders, as noted by Wakefield [1], for which a bio- logically plausible link with vaccination could be made. Thus, the analyses of Taylor and colleagues that found no association between vaccination and onset of regression provide particu- larly persuasive evidence against the hypothesis that MMR may cause autism or exacerbate its symptomatology. ;;
Some parents have reported that the onset of autism in their children occurred following an adverse reaction to vac- cines, such as a convulsion or loss of consciousness. Such reactions were noted in 6 of the 12 cases reported by Wake- field [1]. Adverse reactions to vaccines do occur but, for the most part, these tend to be minor and resolve rather quickly.

Other epidemiological studies have confirmed these negative findings.7 
The pattern of bowel abnormalities identified in the Wakefield et al1 case series was described as a specific ‘autistic enterocolitis’. The case for such an entity has not been proven and there are strong arguments8 against the biological plausibility of the sequence sug- gested as leading to the onset of autism—whereby a previously normal child receives MMR vaccine, develops bowel problems (‘autistic enterocolitis’) which leads to abnormal absorption of dietary or diges- tive constituents and the child then undergoes devel- opmental and/or behavioural regression (‘regressive autism’). ;;
This ‘new-variant’ autism has been incrimi- nated as the cause of the apparent increase in the prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders, although Fombonne9 has presented evidence that the observed increase does not reflect a real rise. 
Although the original paper1 described a short inter- val between vaccination and symptoms, Wakefield has recently postulated10 that the onset of MMR-induced ‘regressive autism’ may occur after a prolonged induc- tion interval and requires in addition co-factors such as an intercurrent infection, the child receiving anti- biotics, atopy in the child, a strong family history of autoimmune disease or maternal MMR or rubella immunisation shortly before, during or after preg- nancy.

Research has focused on the physiological and behavioural effects of dietary change but has not examined the effect of exclusion diets on nutritional intake.
Aims The aim of this study was to examine whether the removal of major dietary staples placed children with autism at risk of nutrient deficiency and compares their food choice with ASD children not following gluten and/or casein free diets.
Methods A postal questionnaire was sent to parents of children aged 3–16 years, diagnosed with ASD belonging to the National Autistic Society in Leicestershire and southern Derbyshire. Detailed dietary information and a 3‐day food diary were collected. The sample size was small: those using gluten/casein free diets (n = 8) and those not following diet (n = 29).
Results Nutrient intakes fell below the Lower Reference Nutrient Intake (LRNI) in 12 children (32%) for zinc, calcium, iron, vitamin A, vitamin B12 and riboflavin in the nondiet group and four children (50%) for zinc and calcium in the diet group. Fruit and vegetable intakes were higher and cereal, bread and potato consumption were lower in those children using gluten and/or casein free diets.
Conclusion No significant differences in the energy, protein and micronutrient intakes were found between the two groups of children. A longitudinal prospective study is suggested to examine whether differences in food choice are the result of dietary intervention or the prerequisite for the successful application of diet in this special group of children.

However, in many children referred to us, parental reports suggest a temporal relationship with exposure to the measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine (Wakefield et al., 1998), an association reported by others (Jyonouchi, Sun, & Le, 2001).

Many efforts have been made to explore the biologic basis of this disorder, but the etiology remains unknown. Recent publications describing upper gastrointestinal abnormalities and ileocolitis have focused attention on gastrointestinal function and morphology in these children. High prevalence of histologic abnormalities in the esophagus, stomach, small intestine and colon, and dysfunction of liver conjugation capacity and intestinal permeability were reported. Three surveys conducted in the United States described high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autistic disorder. Treatment of the digestive problems may have positive effects on their behavior.

Anxiety has risen steadily since the mid-1990s, when a medical investigative team led by A Wakefield postulated that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine may be a causative factor in the development of autism spectrum disorder. Since this initial publication, immunization remains controversial for some parents and the uptake of the MMR vaccine has fallen in some countries, despite much discussion regarding the safety of MMR, a lack of evidence for an association between MMR and autism, and the risks of insufficient protection against wild measles virus infection. The Canadian uptake of MMR in 1998 was 95%, but data do not exist to document any change in Canada since that time. Many clinicians are concerned that the uptake in younger siblings of children with autism is considerably lower.
Further anxiety for parents has been caused by the suggested association between developmental disorders and mercury toxicity due to thimerosal, which is used as a preservative in some vaccines. Many Canadian parents, while continuing to seek chelation therapy in response to this suggestion, are not aware that, in Canada, thimerosal has never been added to MMR, and has not been present in diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus-poliomyelitis or pentavalent vaccines since 1992. It is found in only Hepatitis B vaccine in some provinces.

","BACKGROUND
It has been suggested that vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) is a cause of autism.
METHODS
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all children born in Denmark from January 1991 through December 1998. The cohort was selected on the basis of data from the Danish Civil Registration System, which assigns a unique identification number to every live-born infant and new resident in Denmark. MMR-vaccination status was obtained from the Danish National Board of Health. Information on the children's autism status was obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register, which contains information on all diagnoses received by patients in psychiatric hospitals and outpatient clinics in Denmark. We obtained information on potential confounders from the Danish Medical Birth Registry, the National Hospital Registry, and Statistics Denmark.
RESULTS
Of the 537,303 children in the cohort (representing 2,129,864 person-years), 440,655 (82.0 percent) had received the MMR vaccine. We identified 316 children with a diagnosis of autistic disorder and 422 with a diagnosis of other autistic-spectrum disorders. After adjustment for potential confounders, the relative risk of autistic disorder in the group of vaccinated children, as compared with the unvaccinated group, was 0.92 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.24), and the relative risk of another autistic-spectrum disorder was 0.83 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.07). There was no association between the age at the time of vaccination, the time since vaccination, or the date of vaccination and the development of autistic disorder.
CONCLUSIONS
This study provides strong evidence against the hypothesis that MMR vaccination causes autism.

Eighteen parents of autistic probands with a history of language regression and 70 parents of autistic probands without regression were assessed for features of the BAP and compared with published rates in parents of nonautistic subjects. Parents of probands with regressive and nonregressive autism demonstrated similar rates of the BAP (27.8% vs. 32.9%; P = 0.33). The rate of the BAP was significantly higher in both groups of autism parents than in parents of nonautistic subjects (P ≤ 0.01). Thus, this measure of genetic liability is increased equally in families with both forms of autism when compared with controls. Environmental events are therefore unlikely to be the sole cause of regressive autism in our sample. Environmental events, however, may act in an additive or “second‐hit” fashion in individuals with a genetic vulnerability to autism. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Later a possible association between infection by the measles virus and inflammatory bowel disease was proposed and subse- quently the same authors suggested a link between autism, measles and MMR vaccine. ;;
In Finland a study of people with long-term Crohn’s disease showed no increase in incidence following the introduction of MMR vaccination (Peltola et al, 1986).

Examples are the harms of mercury contained in various vaccines, such as the triple viral (MMR), causing inflammatory bowel disease and autism; hepatitis B and multiple sclerosis vaccine; the SV40 virus in polio and cancer vaccines; reverse transcriptase in chick embryo cells and risks of retrovirus infection; vaccines as a cause of asthma, insulin-dependent diabetes. In some situations there has been clear damage to the health of the population, as happened in England after alarming news about the risks of the triple DTP vaccine in the 1970s and, more recently, the triple viral vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella, also in England, and the hepatitis B vaccine in France. In addition, anti-vaccine activist groups broadcast alarming news through the media, especially the Internet. This situation benefits people and lawyers who, with or without scientific basis for their claims, seek millionaire compensation, which has caused harm to the population, especially in countries like the United States, by increasing the cost of vaccines to make the lawsuits, and the withdrawal of production by several companies, contributing to crises of availability of vaccines.

The highly selective lesson was that seeking to reassure the public about a relatively small risk is disastrous - which it certainly was for the Conservative government at the time. It is now deemed necessary to advertise prominently even the smallest possible risk. This is the rationale behind the recently established Food Standards Agency, which was vigorously promoting the purely theoretical risk of BSE infection through sheep in 2001, for example. Other factors particular to British society have fostered an alarmist response to cell phone EMF at odds with that of other European countries such as Holland.

While this article will review the clinical, anatomic, and pathologic features seen in autism, the primary focus will be to present a new and provocative unifying theory regarding the underlying mechanisms causing this disorder. Current research advances, some controversial, will be discussed, and a novel definition of autism as a “circuit syndrome” will be presented. The work elaborated here will tie many of the disparate findings together, based on the idea that autism arises from abnormalities of the cerebellolimbic circuitry. Some of the more alternative theories of autism, such as mercury toxicity, linkage to the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, and the use of secretin will be discussed. Finally, pharmacologic treatment options will be reviewed.

Possibly, a breakthrough will re- sult after publication of several studies reporting new ob- servations of significant gastrointestinal pathology in autism or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (14-17). In this 
review, the new observations, particularly those on the in- testinal tract, are described, as well as earlier studies indi- cating a link between gastrointestinal function and autism.;;
In a study published in 1998, 12 children diagnosed with autism (all of the regressive pattern) and exhibiting a variety of GI ailments, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloating, were examined extensively (14). The GI symptoms had developed coincident with the onset of au- tistic behavior, according to the parents. ;;
Secretin, a peptide hormone released by endocrine cells within the duodenal mucosa, promotes sodium bicarbonate and water secretion by the pancreas. It is important to note that this study describes altered function in the upper GI tract of autistic children, whereas the lym- phoid nodular hyperplasia described by Wakefield et al. (14, 15) was observed in the lowest portion of the small intestine, namely the ileum. The results of these different studies taken together suggest that significant and wide- spread GI pathophysiology may accompany autism, at least within a subpopulation of patients. ;;
Pathological inflammation of the intestinal mucosa has long been recognized as a primary symptom in celiac dis- ease and inflammatory bowel disease. The recent work de- tailed above indicates that there is also pathological inflam- mation of the ileum in autism (14-17), although there is no evidence to support the view that gluten or casein cause the inflammation. Intestinal inflammation can be regarded as the consequence of the disruption of the complex interaction between all of the ceIls of the mucosa (immune and non- immune), ;;
In Crohn's disease, blood proteins are lost into the intestinal lumen and are excreted into the feces; the extent of protein loss correlates positively with the length of the bowel that is inflamed (53). In the study by Wakefield et al. (14) examination of histological sections of intestinal tissue from autistic patients revealed a near doubling of the num- ber of lymphoid follicles, as weIl as follicle enlargement and merging of adjacent follicles. More recently, Furlano et al. (54) reported that neutrophils and lymphocytes infiltrated the epithelium overlying the follicles; neutrophils also in- filtrated the crypt epithelium that lies between the villi and provides a constant supply of new epithelial cells for the villi. ;;
There was no evidence that the enterocytes themselves were ren- dered more permeable, as occurs in celiac disease, wherein a near total loss of the intestinal cell lining is manifest. In keeping with this distinction, the pathology reported to oc- cur in the ileum of autistic subjects (14-17) is much more subtle than that observed in celiac disease. These consider- ations do not disaIlow a role for gluten and casein in intes- tinal hyperpermeability. ;;
Lacking is any evidence that gliadin and milk proteins, or their products, produce these cytokines in the autistic gut. Vaccines. The intestinal pathology noted in the study of Wakefield et al. (14), namely, the hyperplastic lymph nodes in the ileum and colon, suggests that the immune system of the gut has been seriously challenged in the au- tistic patients. Although Wakefield et al. did not draw a conclusion as to the cause of the pathology, they noted parental reports that the children had received the trivalent measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine before undergoing behavioral regression. ;;
Autistic individuals frequently exhibit mental retarda- tion as well as unusual behaviors such as perseveration. These are indications of impaired CNS function ( I , 85). The studies described above provide evidence that, in autism, much of the GI tract, extending from the esophagus to the colon, possesses pathology (14-17). The possibility cannot be discounted that any GI pathology that exists is unrelated to the function of the CNS. ;;
Myelin is necessary for nor- mal conduction of the action potential in myelinated nerve fibers. Wakefield et al. (14) observed that, in conjunction with the intestinal pathology observed in his autistic popu- lation, vitamin B12 absorption was significantly reduced in all eight autistic individuals in which urinary methylmalonic acid excretion was measured. Methylmalonic acid is nor- mally converted to succinyl coenzyme A by a vitamin B I 2 dependent mutase.;; 
Dietary vitamin BJ2 deficiency results in impaired mutase activity and spillover of methylmalonic acid into the urine. Wakefield et al. (14) proposed that nerve myelogenesis, which is dependent upon vitamin B12' may be impaired in autistic children as a result. Direct evidence of vitamin B I 2 deficiency and impaired myelogenesis in autism is lacking at this time. ;;","cites for information;;

","Abstract
Background. 
An outbreak of measles occurred in Ireland between December 1999 and July 2000. The majority of cases were in north Dublin, the catchment area of The Children’s University Hospital (TCUH).
Methods. 
Details of all of the 111 children attending the hospital with a diagnosis of measles between December 1999 and July 2000 were prospectively entered into a database. Charts were subsequently reviewed to extract epidemiologic and clinical details. National figures were obtained from the National Disease Surveillance Centre.
Results. 
In the study period 355 attended TCUH with a serologic or clinical diagnosis of measles, and 111 were admitted (47% female, 53% male). The main indications for admission were dehydration in 79%, pneumonia or pneumonitis in 47% and tracheitis in 32%. Thirteen children (11.7% of those admitted) required treatment in the intensive care unit, and in 7 of these mechanical ventilation was necessary. There were 3 deaths as a result of measles. Public health measures to curb spread of the disease included promotion of immunization for susceptible children nationally and recommending administration of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) from the age of 6 months, in North Dublin.
Conclusion. 
This outbreak of measles posed a major challenge to the hospital and the community for the first half of 2000. The national MMR immunization rate before the outbreak was gravely suboptimal at 79%, whereas the rate in North Dublin, the catchment area of TCUH, was <70%. Three children died as a result of a vaccine-preventable illness.",Final section; “Discussion”;;,"Parents are confused by mixed messages from the medical profession and the media as to whether vaccines are safe.

Developmental Disorders ","OBJECTIVE: A relationship between autism and gastrointes- tinal (GI) immune dysregulation has been postulated based on incidence of GI complaints as well as macroscopically observed lymphonodular hyperplasia and microscopically determined enterocolitis in pediatric patients with autism. To evaluate GI immunity, we quantitatively assessed levels of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-1􏰃, produced by intestinal biopsies of children with pervasive developmental disorders. 
METHODS: Fifteen patients, six with pervasive developmen- tal disorders and nine age-matched controls, presenting for diagnostic colonoscopy were enrolled. Endoscopic biopsies were organ cultured, supernatants were harvested, and IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1􏰃 levels were quantified by ELISA. Tissue histology was evaluated by blinded pathologists. 
RESULTS: Concentrations of IL-6 from intestinal organ cul- ture supernatants of patients with pervasive developmental disorders (median 318.5 pg/ml, interquartile range 282.0– 393.0 pg/ml) when compared with controls (median 436.9 pg/ml, interquartile range 312.6–602.5 pg/ml) were not significantly different (p 􏰇 0.0987). Concentrations of IL-8 (median 84,000 pg/ml, interquartile range 16,000–143,000 pg/ml) when compared with controls (median 177,000 pg/ ml, interquartile range 114,000–244,000 pg/ml) were not significantly different (p 􏰇 0.0707). Concentrations of IL-1􏰃 (median 0.0 pg/ml, interquartile range 0.0–94.7 pg/ ml) when compared with controls (median 0.0 pg/ml, inter- quartile range 0.0–60.2 pg/ml) were not significantly dif- ferent (p 􏰇 0.8826). Tissue histology was nonpathological for all patients. 
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated no significant differ- ence in production of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1􏰃 between patients with pervasive developmental disorders and age-matched controls. In general, intestinal levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were lower in patients with pervasive developmental disorders than in age-matched controls. These data fail to support an association between autism and GI inflammation. (Am J Gastroenterol 2003;98:1777–1782. © 2003 by Am. Coll. of Gastroenterology) 
",introduction;;,"The etiology and pathogenesis of pervasive developmental disorders remain unknown, but recent investigations have identified developmental abnormalities of the limbic system and cerebellar–cortical connections, immune system dys- regulation, and GI dysfunction as possible mechanisms (2– 4). 
A relationship between GI immune dysregulation and autism has been postulated based on incidence of GI com- plaints, macroscopic observations of lymphonodular hyper- plasia (LNH), and histological findings of enterocolitis in pediatric patients with autism (5–7). In a cohort of 60 patients with both developmental disorders and intestinal symptoms, Wakefield et al. reported the presence of ileal and colonic LNH in a significantly higher number of pa- tients with autism compared with controls (7).

Physician education of families and care of patients in these three topic areas are important public health measures. First, pediatricians are always actively promoting public health through immunization, so the 2003 vaccination recommendations are critiqued along with perceived barriers to proper immunization. New information about smallpox vaccine is included in this year's review because of increased concerns about the use of smallpox as a weapon of bioterrorism since the world events in recent years. Next, the continued study of the management of hyperbilirubinemia in preventing kernicterus is examined. Finally, the management and prevention of animal-induced injuries is reviewed. In each of these areas, the pediatrician plays a prominent role in promoting the health and well being of children.

The epidemiology of autism has generated much discussion and research; we report the most recent data, as well as recent findings about controversial issues purporting to cause the increased prevalence rate observed in the past decade. Finally, we discuss the prognosis for individuals with autism, indicating the challenges faced by patients, families, and professionals aiming to optimize their outcome.
",middle section;“Clinical Correlates of Autism ”;;,"The issue of regression in autism came to the forefront as part of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine controversy. A 1998 article appearing in Lancet described a small group of children with autism who had diarrhea (referred to as autistic enterocolitis) and who lost previously acquired developmen- tal skills after receiving an MMR vaccine at age 15 months (51). However, another study found that 17% of the children had bowel symptoms and that this rate did not change over the 20-year period for which data were examined and which included the introduction of the MMR vaccine in 1988 (50).

In this study, we postulated that infectious agent antigens such as streptokinase, dietary peptides (gliadin and casein) and ethyl mercury (xenobiotic) bind to different lymphocyte receptors and tissue enzyme (DPP IV or CD26). We assessed this hypothesis first by measuring IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies against CD26, CD69, streptokinase (SK), gliadin and casein peptides and against ethyl mercury bound to human serum albumin in patients with autism. A significant percentage of children with autism developed anti-SK, anti-gliadin and casein peptides and anti-ethyl mercury antibodies, concomitant with the appearance of anti-CD26 and anti-CD69 autoantibodies. These antibodies are synthesized as a result of SK, gliadin, casein and ethyl mercury binding to CD26 and CD69, indicating that they are specific. Immune absorption demonstrated that only specific antigens, like CD26, were capable of significantly reducing serum anti-CD26 levels. However, for direct demonstration of SK, gliadin, casein and ethyl mercury to CD26 or CD69, microtiter wells were coated with CD26 or CD69 alone or in combination with SK, gliadin, casein or ethyl mercury and then reacted with enzyme labeled rabbit anti-CD26 or anti-CD69. Adding these molecules to CD26 or CD69 resulted in 28–86 % inhibition of CD26 or CD69 binding to anti-CD26 or anti-CD69 antibodies. The highest % binding of these antigens or peptides to CD26 or CD69 was attributed to SK and the lowest to casein peptides. We, therefore, propose that bacterial antigens (SK), dietary peptides (gliadin, casein) and Thimerosal (ethyl mercury) in individuals with pre-disposing HLA molecules, bind to CD26 or CD69 and induce antibodies against these molecules. In conclusion, this study is apparently the first to demonstrate that dietary peptides, bacterial toxins and xenobiotics bind to lymphocyte receptors and/or tissue enzymes, resulting in autoimmune reaction in children with autism.",introduction;;,"If covalent adducts of drugs or other chemical compounds are formed in GALT, it seems reasonable that they may lead to immune responses and chemically-induced Type-I-Type IV allergic reactions (10). 
Many infectious agents including measles, Rubella virus and Cytomegalovirus have long been suspected as etiologic factors in autism (I 1- 13). In fact, by reviewing the scientific literature, we found that over 60 different microbial peptides have been reported to cross-react with human brain tissue and MBP that induce T-cell responses but can also induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (14-16).

","Despite the extensive media exposure that viruses such as West Nile, Norwalk, and Ebola have received lately, and the emerging threat that old pathogens may reappear as new agents of terrorism, measles virus (MV) persists as one of the leading causes of death by infectious agents worldwide, approaching the annual mor- tality rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1. For most MV victims, fatality is indirect: Virus-induced transient immunosuppression predisposes the individual to op- portunistic infections that, left untreated, can result in mortality. In rare cases, MV may also cause progressive neurodegenerative disease. During the past five years (1998– 2002), development of animal models and the application of reverse genetics and immunological assays have collectively contributed to major progress in our under- standing of MV biology and pathogenesis. Nevertheless, questions and controversies remain that are the basis for future research. In this review, major advances and current debates are discussed, including MV receptor usage, the cellular basis of immunosup- pression, the suspected role of MV in “nonviral” diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Paget’s disease, and the controversy surrounding MV vaccine safety. 
",middle section;“MEASLES VACCINATION ”;;,"It is certain that the most contentious debate in the measles field concerns the role that vaccines, such as the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, may play in childhood autism. The controversy, sparked by a report in Lancet (128) that hypothesized an association between onset of autistic behaviors and MV RNA sequences in the gut, has deeply penetrated the public consciousness, and many parents are expressing doubts about the value of vaccinating their children. The Lancet report resonated, in part, because many parents of autistic children recalled strong adverse responses to the MMR vaccine (fever, constant crying) and noted a profound loss of acquired skills following vaccine delivery.

These mixed findings may have been related to external factors, such as intermittent reports in the media claiming that MMR vacci- nation may cause autism (Wakefieldet al., 1998).In addition, immunizations are often given at schools, health fairs, and other locations that make accurate recording in health plan claims data challenging.

The authors described 12 children who had chronic enterocolitis associated with a regressive developmental disorder.9 After a period of apparent normality, these children were said to have lost acquired skills, including communication;;
By 2001 they claimed to have found similar colonic lesions in over 150 children with autism, in whom the main gastrointestinal presentation was abdominal pain with either constipation or diarrhea.10 
The most worrisome feature of The Lancet article was a suggestion that the autistic syndrome was precipitated by measles-mumps- rubella (MMR) vaccination.9 This conclusion was based mainly on the fact that, in eight patients, the onset of behavioral problems was linked, by either the parents or the child’s physician, with MMR vaccination. ;;
Nevertheless, it caused great consternation among parents and some health professionals. Although the authors acknowledged in their article that they had not proved an association between MMR vaccination and the proposed syndrome,9 there were adverse comments about the safety of the MMR vaccine at the press conference that launched the publication.12 
Few issues in health care are as emotive as the safety of vaccines to be administered to children. ;;
A new study from California points to the same conclusion.26 
Five years after the controversial report in The Lancet,9 parents and health professionals can have considerable confidence in the safety of the MMR vaccine. If vaccination did occasionally cause an unusual variant of autism, this occurrence would have to be so rare as to escape detection in well-designed epidemiologic studies. ;;

To review the recent literature on possible causes of the increase in frequency of diagnosed autism reported from three countries, and to compare the medical diagnoses and drug therapy from a new series of autistic boys and their mothers with that of comparable nonautistic boys and their mothers.
Design. Case‐control evaluation.
Participants. Members of over 250 general practices in the United Kingdom.
Measurements and Main Results. Frequency of exposure to drugs and presence of preexisting clinical illnesses in autistic children and their mothers were compared with nonautistic children and their mothers over time. According to published studies, the incidence of boys diagnosed with autism rose dramatically in the 1990s. Numerous published studies have concluded that the measles‐mumps‐rubella vaccine is not responsible for the large rise in diagnosed autism. In our study, boys diagnosed with autism had medical and drug histories, such as vaccines, before diagnosis, that were closely similar to those of nonautistic boys, except that developmental and sensory disorders were far more common in autistic boys. No material differences during pregnancy were found between the mothers of autistic boys and those of nonautistic boys in relation to illness or drug therapy. In the early 1990s, boys with diagnosed developmental disorders were infrequently diagnosed with autism. In the later 1990s, such boys more often were diagnosed with autism.
Conclusion. A major cause of the recent large increase in the number of boys diagnosed with autism probably is due to changing diagnostic practices.

Interest in the risks and causes of autism was stimulated by a 1998 report of a small series of cases of autism that were related in time to receipt of the MMR vaccine, with subsequent development of a chronic intestinal disorder.5 Based on this case series, the authors postulated that the MMR vaccine might be causally related to risk of autism. ;;
Our study is consistent with an increase in incidence of autism in recent birth cohorts.”6 
The authors of the 1998 article5 responded with a scathing letter to the editor criticizing the more recent study6 because it did not take into account a proposed “catch-up comparison involving the MMR vaccine.”7 The letter contained a graph showing the number of cases of autism in California from 1960–1990 based on data provided in a California report from the Office of Development Services (http://www.das. ca.gov). ;;
The authors found no correlation between the increasing incidence of autism with each successive birth cohort and the proportion of children who received MMR vaccination, which was approximately 95% for all boys in each consecutive birth cohort. These results, based on cumulative incidence in consecutive cohorts, provide conclusive evidence that the MMR vaccine could not have caused the dramatic rise in incidence of autism in the GPRD population studied, as proposed in 1988.5 
In a subsequent paper based on the same 106 boys,10 a group of authors sent for the original case records evaluated in the birth cohort analysis discussed above.8 ;;
The authors concluded that there was strong evidence against the proposition that gastrointestinal disorders played a material role in the rising incidence of diagnosed autism in this population of boys. None of the cases involved a diagnosed illness similar to that described earlier.4, 5

Studies published since the Institue of Medicine report have continued not to find an increased risk of autistic spectrum disorder associated with measles–mumps–rubella. The vaccine also has not been found to be associated with a unique syndrome of developmental regression and gastrointestinal disorders. The evidence now is convincing that the measles–mumps–rubella vaccine does not cause autism or any particular subtypes of autistic spectrum disorder.

",introduction;;,"The publication in 1998 of an hypothesis that the measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccine may cause autism as a result of persistent mea- sles virus infection of the gastrointestinal tract [1] generated much concern among parents, particularly those who have children with autism.

","Health scares are characterized by mass media reporting that generates panic about a particular health issue or intervention, and those involved often require information. This article describes a study that aimed to examine the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination scare, its impact on parents of young children, and its effect on their need for information. Seventeen semi-structured interviews were carried out with parents in Sheffield, UK. Analysis of the interview transcripts revealed several categories including the one presented in this article, ‘Information and the MMR vaccine’. The health scare increased parents’ information needs in relation to their decision whether to have their child vaccinated. Parents viewed traditional sources of information critically as they did not consider them to be trustworthy. Parents considered trustworthiness of the information source to be an important factor. Ongoing work in this area is investigating these issues through a large-scale, quantitative study.

This support was for a variety of reasons. A number of the parents interviewed had accessed the research undertaken by Wakefield et al.

Conclusion;;","This will be done by drawing on the documents of the BSE Inquiry and concentrating on what one counsellor called ‘an- other side of the [BSE] story’—that is, the story about the safety of medicines and vaccines, as opposed to the safety of food. By tracing the connections between the two discourses in this way, it is possible to inform the MMR vaccine debate by showing that concern about the MMR vaccine did not begin in 1998 with the publication of the now controversial paper by Wakefield et al. It began a decade earlier, when the British government was grappling with the dual task of promoting its MMR vaccine campaign from October 1988 and trying to prevent the transmission of BSE. ;;
Within the context of the MMR debate, this call was made by the editor of Lancet in 1998 following the publication of the Wakefield et al. paper which speculated on a possible association between the vaccine, autism-like disorders and inflammatory bowel disorders. This paper evoked much criticism from Public Health officials and others, mainly because the case relied on anecdotal evidence (see Payne and Mason, 1998; Lindley and Milla, 1998; O’Brien et al., 1998; Lee et al., 1998; Bedford et al., 1998; Beale, 1998; and Black et al., 1998 for a range of criticisms). ;;
Japanese data shows that one in 400 vaccinees experienced meningitis or meningo-en- cephalitis associated with Urabe strain (Hilleman, 1992). I am not suggesting that this mumps strain of the MMR vaccine is responsible for the autism-like disorders and bowel problems identified in the Wakefield et al. paper, although this is a possibility for others to judge. The point is that a new vaccine was being produced in January 1990 and the discussion at the BSE working group meetings revolved around preventing the transmission of BSE-infected ma- terial through MMR as well as other vaccines. ;;
My concern here has been whether the public should have been informed about any uncertainty at the time. My argument is that it is preferable to rock the boat little by little, in order to prevent it from overturning completely in the future, even though this means being far more open with the public about potential vaccine associated problems and allowing space for the publication of anecdotal reports about vaccine associated effects, such as the one by Wakefield et al. in 1998 that provoked so much criticism. 
Critics argue that the 1998 paper contributed to the scare over the MMR vaccine. ","discusses;;

We report on the validity of the computerized diagnoses of autism in a large case-control study investigating the possible association between autism and the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in the UK using the General Practitioner Research Database (GPRD). We examined anonymized copies of all relevant available clinical reports, including general practitioners' (GP) notes, consultant, speech therapy and educational psychologists reports, on 318 subjects born between 1973 and 1997 with a diagnosis of autism or a related disorder recorded in their electronic general practice record.
Methods
Data were abstracted to a case validation form allowing for the identification of developmental symptoms relevant to the diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). Information on other background clinical and familial features was also abstracted. A subset of 50 notes was coded independently by 2 raters to derive reliability estimates for key clinical characteristics.
Results
For 294 subjects (92.5%) the diagnosis of PDD was confirmed after review of the records. Of these, 180 subjects (61.2%) fulfilled criteria for autistic disorder. The mean age at first recording of a PDD diagnosis in the GPRD database was 6.3 years (SD = 4.6). Consistent with previous estimates, the proportion of subjects experiencing regression in the course of their development was 19%. Inter-rater reliability for the presence of a PDD diagnosis was good (kappa = .73), and agreement on clinical features such as regression, age of parental recognition of first symptoms, language delay and presence of epilepsy was also good (kappas ranging from .56 to 1.0).
Conclusions
This study provides evidence that the positive predictive value of a diagnosis of autism recorded in the GPRD is high.
",Background;;," Improved operationalisation of diagnostic definitions within nosographies has occurred (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; World Health Organization, 1992), in parallel with the development of more precise diagnostic instruments such as the Autism Diagnostic Interview [2] and the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule [3]. There has also been an increasing concern by the public about this group of disorders, prompted, in part, by concern that the rates of PDD may have increased in recent decades [4–6]; and that the cause of the increase may be due to the side effects of vaccination [7–9] or increased exposure of young infants to neurotoxins such as methylmercury or thimerosal [10].

","Background: Immunization programmes are ethically defensible and society has a significant role to play in providing vaccination against measles and safeguarding herd immunity to optimize its individuals’ capabilities. Since preventive actions interfere with individuals who consider themselves as healthy, public health strategies – as distinct from advice in a clinical consultation – require something approaching certainty as to benefits and possible side effects of an intervention. The principle of individual autonomy, a fundamental value in bioethics, often makes discussions covering ethical issues in public health interventions difficult and non-productive as to practical solutions. In encounters intended to provide information on vaccination, discussions regarding risks tend to simplify the issue into an individual one: either the child gets measles or not, or is affected by side effects or not. Method and conclusions: A model is suggested for identification and analysis of the ethical conflicts in measles vaccination programmes, which contains two different dimensions: the affected persons and the relevant ethical principles. Justice as solidarity, not utility, should be paired with autonomy in ethical deliberations on preventive health interventions such as a vaccination programme for measles. If the goal is solidarity rather than conformity, the parents must be free to decide what they think is right, because that is what moral responsibility is all about. Solidarity, however, could never be accepted as an argument without parents trusting the messages from the health institutions and availability of reasonable societal support for those who claim an association between vaccinations and possible side effects.

Particularly after a case series12 concerning measles–mumps–rubella vaccine (MMR), autism, and gastrointestinal symptoms received wide publicity, the public became concerned about a possible link. Understanding people’s mental models13 of autism, that is, their existing understanding and prior beliefs about vaccines and autism, might help to improve communication about vaccines among vaccine providers, policy makers, and parents/patients.;;
For open-ended questions such as, “What made you think that ______’s symptoms might be related to a vaccination?” the most frequent answers were summarized by category (newspaper article, family/friends, Web site), and the remainder were independently reviewed by 2 of the authors (A. B. and E. J. W.).
To assess whether report or reporter characteristics changed after the promulgation of news relating to autism and vaccines, we analyzed data by the date that VAERS reports were received. The highly publicized case series about vaccines and autism was published in February 1998.12 In July 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the US Public Health Service recommended that manufacturers remove or reduce thimerosal in vaccines.11 Two separate date stratifications—1 with March 1, 1998, as a cutoff and 1 with August 1, 1999, as a cutoff—were performed.;;
Other potential influences are less important in the respondents’ minds. Nevertheless, the media clearly played an influential role.
Approximately three quarters of the VAERS reports were received after the original case series was published,12 and two thirds were received after the AAP/US Public Health Service’s thimerosal recommendation.11 Respondents whose reports were received after the original case series was published were more likely than earlier reporters to cite the MMR vaccine as a contributing factor.;;
Respondents whose reports were received after the original case series was published were more likely than earlier reporters to cite the MMR vaccine as a contributing factor. One respondent specifically mentioned the Wakefield case series12 as a reason to attribute her child’s symptoms to a vaccine; her VAERS report, which was received 2 years after the article was published, listed MMR as the sole vaccine. Lingam et al. reported that parents who had observed regression in their autistic children—rather than delayed development—were more likely to speculate about the MMR vaccine and other possible causes of autism.17;;","credits;;

","The mechanisms behind autoimmune reaction to nervous system antigens in autism are not understood. We assessed the reactivity of sera from 50 autism patients and 50 healthy controls to specific peptides from gliadin and the cerebellum. A significant percentage of autism patients showed elevations in antibodies against gliadin and cerebellar peptides simultaneously. For examining cross-reaction between dietary proteins and cerebellar antigens, antibodies were prepared in rabbits, and binding of rabbit anti-gliadin, anti-cerebellar peptides, anti-MBP, anti-milk, anti-egg, anti-soy and anti-corn to either gliadin- or cerebellar-antigen-coated wells was measured. In comparison to anti-gliadin peptide binding to gliadin peptide at 100%, the reaction of anti-cerebellar peptide to gliadin peptide was 22%, whereas the binding of anti-myelin basic protein (MBP), anti-milk, anti-egg and anti-soy to gliadin was less than 10%. Further examination of rabbit anti-gliadin (EQVPLVQQ) and anti-cerebellar (EDVPLLED) 8 amino acid (AA) peptides with human serum albumin (HSA) and an unrelated peptide showed no binding, but the reaction of these antibodies with both the cerebellar and gliadin peptides was greater than 60%.

This article looks at the evidence for a link between MMR and autism, finding that while a plausible hypothesis has been constructed, there is no substantive evidence for such a link and that the quality of this evidence is, in many cases, poor.

The controversy was brought to the forefront following a 1998 case series report in which the authors hypothesized a “unique disease process” of bowel abnormalities and autism in a small group of children who had received MMR immunization.2 The authors hypothesized that the MMR vaccine causes inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, producing a leaky bowel that allows for the circulation of neurotoxins that can cause central nervous system damage and developmental regression.3;;
The studies reviewed here sought to evaluate whether a causal relationship can be determined between administration of MMR vaccine and the development of autism. In the first of these investigations, Wakefield et al.2 submitted a case series report of 12 children between 3 and 11 years of age who were referred to a pediatric gastroenterology clinic with symptoms of enterocolitis and a history of normal development followed by a loss of acquired skills. All children underwent gastrointestinal, neurologic, and behavioral assessment.;;
Although the authors were unable to demonstrate an association between autism and MMR vaccine, the findings sparked suspicion regarding the safety of the vaccine in both the general public and the medical community.
Following the Wakefield et al.2 report, another group conducted a cross-sectional epidemiologic study to evaluate whether the MMR vaccine could be causally associated with autism.9 Four hundred ninety-eight autistic children born between 1979 and 1998 were identified using the special needs and disability registers of North East Thames, UK. A time-trend analysis was performed to evaluate whether there was a change in the incidence of autism after the addition of the MMR vaccine to the immunization schedule.;;
Since the number of children with autism continued to increase, the investigators concluded that administration of MMR vaccine was not linked to the development of autism.
Taylor et al.16 conducted a follow-up population study to investigate whether administration of MMR vaccine was associated with bowel problems and developmental regression in children with autism, as was hypothesized by Wakefield et al.2 Autistic children born from 1979 to 1998 were identified using the special needs and disability registers of North East Thames, UK.

Published studies during the past year about three topics important to the pediatric clinician—- immunizations, neonatal jaundice, and animal-induced injuries—are concisely reviewed.
Recent findings 
Recent updates regarding vaccines including the questionable link with autism, implementation of universal influenza vaccination for young children, the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccine against invasive disease, and new information on pertussis, varicella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, measles, and rotavirus vaccination are discussed. No association between measles/mumps/rubella vaccine or thimerosal-containing pertussis vaccine and autism is evident. Universal influenza vaccination for children 6 to 23 months of age will be recommended for the 2004–2005 flu season, and this implementation should reduce significant school absenteeism as well as complications seen last year including encephalopathy, seizures, respiratory failure, and pneumonia. Pneumococcal vaccine significantly reduces rates of invasive pneumococcal vaccine in healthy and HIV-infected children, although it does not appear to greatly affect otitis media rates. A reduction in post-vaccine febrile seizures appears to be present since the introduction of acellular pertussis vaccine. Multiple outbreaks in varicella have been reported since the introduction of the varicella vaccine, and a booster vaccination may be necessary in the future. Methods for detecting and preventing severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia are reviewed, as well as anticipated recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics for the detection and management of hyperbilirubinemia. High bilirubin levels in preterm infants may result in hearing dysfunction and developmental impairment. The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended a higher level of monitoring for newborn jaundice and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in an effort to prevent kernicterus and sequelae from elevated bilirubin levels, including post-discharge follow-up appointment by day 3 to 5 of age. Dog bites in children with resultant post-traumatic stress disorder, rabies, and salmonellosis from pet reptiles in the home are also addressed. Clinicians need to be aware of the risk for rabies bites, need to recognize that dog bites in children appear to cause post-traumatic stress disorder in more than half of cases, and need to know how to educate patients on how to prevent salmonellosis from pet reptiles and amphibians.
Summary 
Progress has been made in immunizations, especially immunization for influenza, pneumonia, and pertussis. It is recommended that monitoring for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia be more thorough to prevent the consequences of this condition.

","Clinical and subclinical seizures occur frequently among children with autistic spectrum disorders. Electrographic status epilepticus in sleep, or continuous spike-wave in slow-wave sleep, is a typical feature of acquired epileptic aphasia and Landau-Kleffner syndrome. Seizures and epilepsy are more common among children with autistic spectrum disorder who experience language regression, especially those who experience language regression after the age of 2 years. Although the seizures associated with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and with acquired epileptic aphasia can be easily treated, improvement in language function often does not follow successful treatment of seizures. There are no published randomized clinical trials of treatments for Landau-Kleffner syndrome or for autistic language regression. Broad-spectrum antiepileptic drugs not associated with cognitive slowing are probably the treatment of choice for epilepsy among children with autistic spectrum disorder. Large multisite trials are needed to determine treatment efficacy among children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and acquired epileptic aphasia and to establish whether there is a cause-effect relationship between electrographic status epilepticus in sleep or continuous spike-wave in slow-wave sleep and autistic language regression.

","Increases in the reported prevalence of autism and autistic spectrum disorders in recent years have fueled concern over possible environmental causes. The author reviews the available survey literature and finds evidence of large increases in prevalence in both the United States and the United Kingdom that cannot be explained by changes in diagnostic criteria or improvements in case ascertainment. Incomplete ascertainment of autism cases in young child populations is the largest source of predictable bias in prevalence surveys; however, this bias has, if anything, worked against the detection of an upward trend in recent surveys. Comparison of autism rates by year of birth for specific geographies provides the strongest basis for trend assessment. Such comparisons show large recent increases in rates of autism and autistic spectrum disorders in both the U.S. and the U.K. Reported rates of autism in the United States increased from <3 per 10,000 children in the 1970s to >30 per 10,000 children in the 1990s, a 10-fold increase. In the United Kingdom, autism rates rose from <10 per 10,000 in the 1980s to roughly 30 per 10,000 in the 1990s. Reported rates for the full spectrum of autistic disorders rose from the 5 to 10 per 10,000 range to the 50 to 80 per 10,000 range in the two countries. A precautionary approach suggests that the rising incidence of autism should be a matter of urgent public concern.

","Objective: Determine the effect of a moderate dose multivitamin/mineral supplement on children with autistic spectrum disorder.
Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-month study.
Subjects: Twenty (20) children with autistic spectrum disorder, ages 3–8 years.
Results: A Global Impressions parental questionnaire found that the supplement group reported statistically significant improvements in sleep and gastrointestinal problems compared to the placebo group. An evaluation of vitamin B6 levels prior to the study found that the autistic children had substantially elevated levels of B6 compared to a control group of typical children (75% higher, p < 0.0000001). Vitamin C levels were measured at the end of the study, and the placebo group had levels that were significantly below average for typical children, whereas the supplement group had near-average levels.
Discussion: The finding of high vitamin B6 levels is consistent with recent reports of low levels of pyridoxal-5-phosphate and low activity of pyridoxal kinase (i.e., pyridoxal is only poorly converted to pyridoxal- 5-phosphate, the enzymatically active form). This may explain the functional need for high-dose vitamin B6 supplementation in many children and adults with autism.

This article presents moral arguments relating to conflicts between individual autonomy and collective responsibilities in vaccination decisions with a view to informing and advising health professionals and improving the effectiveness of education policies in avoiding resurgence of endemic measles. Lower population immunity, due to falling uptake, is hastening the need for greater public awareness of the consequences for the population. Vaccination refusals go hand in hand with responsibilities owed to future generations and society in not knowingly contributing to preventable harms. Issues such as parents’ rights are considered and balanced against: collective responsibilities for public health; permissibility of ‘free-riding’; conflicting duties of health professionals; and possible enforcement of vaccination. It is suggested that the arguments may form a persuasive tool for the practice of health professionals involved in informing and supporting parents’ vaccination decisions.

","Objective. During the second half of the 1990s and the first years of the 2000s a declining coverage for MMR vaccination in two-year-olds was observed in Sweden. The aim was to assess reasons for postponement or non-vaccination. Design. A telephone survey using a structured questionnaire on parents’ attitudes regarding their choice to postpone or abstain from vaccinating their child. Setting. The County of Östergötland in Sweden. Subjects. A total of 203 parents of children who had no registered date for MMR vaccination at a Child Health Centre. Main outcome measures. Parental reasons for non-vaccination. Results. In all, 26 of the 203 children had received MMR vaccination but this had not been registered. Of those not vaccinated, 40% of the parents had decided to abstain and 60% to postpone vaccination. Fear of side effects was the most common reason for non-vaccination in both groups. The main source of information was the media followed by the Child Health Centre. Parents with a single child more often postponed vaccination and those who abstained were more likely to have had a discussion with a doctor or nurse about MMR vaccine. Conclusion. Postponers and abstainers may have different reasons for their decision. The role of well-trained healthcare staff in giving advice and an opportunity to discuss MMR vaccination with concerned parents is very important.

Two contrasting case studies are used, air pollution and childhood immunisation (specifically the MMR vaccination). The results confirm social networks and everyday experiences, and social normalisation of behaviour as important influences upon learning, responses to information, and the taking of personal action. People require information to support the freedom to make personal choices. However, the two cases illustrate that notions of collective responsibility are weaker, in the case of MMR overridden by personal responsibility, in the case of air pollution being transferred to other institutions. Conclusions are developed relating to information provision in an age promoting individualisation and retraction of government, specifically the need for explicit engagement with the benefits (personal and collective) of health protection measures.

To explore the issues surrounding the falling rates of MMR vaccination following the publication of a controversial study by Wakefield et al.
Design/methodology/approach
In order to take a fresh look at the MMR crisis, the Greek tragedy, Antigone, was used as a “strong plot” to de‐contextualise the underlying social and political issues. In this short paper, two themes are explored that emerge from reading Antigone with respect to the unfolding crisis of public confidence in the MMR vaccine: first, the challenge to government in the form of a decrease in public trust in government and government policies; and second, how such a challenge assumes significance and, arising from that, the question of how one might respond to the challenge.
Findings
The MMR debate throws issues of importance to society into relief – for example, public trust in government and science; and notions of public good versus rational choice in public policy on vaccination, However, much of the debate has been polarised into good versus evil – good and evil being subjective positions that are interchangeable, depending on the side one favours. It is argued that the issues are more complex than this, and are as much to do with political consent and the bargain between citizen and state.
Originality/value
Using “strong plots” to theorise about current issues is powerful because it allows one to explore them from different angles and challenge one's understanding. Antigone provides us with a way of standing back from the MMR crisis and re‐conceptualising the issues to capture the essence of the underlying debate.
","introduction;;
Middle section; “The MMR crisis”;;","Since the publication of Andrew Wakefield's research into a form of bowel disease and autism in children and a possible link with the MMR vaccine (Wakefield et al., 1998), rates of immunisation with MMR have fallen dramatically. There has been much debate, and some research into possible reasons.;;
In 1998, a rather esoteric paper entitled “Ileal lymphoid‐nodular hyperplasia, non‐specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children” was published in The Lancet (Wakefield et al., 1998). The story of why this obscurely titled paper led to a moral panic and a falling rate of MMR vaccination in children is of interest for precisely that reason – why are some issues (that seem to come from nowhere) taken up whilst others are not?","credits;;

","During the last two centuries, the world has seen a substantial increase in the number and availability of vaccines for the prevention of infectious disease. Smallpox vaccine remains the most celebrated vaccine-related achievement in human history, but worldwide reductions in many other diseases including measles, mumps, rubella, polio, diphtheria, and whooping cough (Bordetella pertussis) also illustrate the power of vaccination in controlling outbreaks of contagious diseases. Ironically, as advances in vaccination successfully limit disease outbreaks, the impact that these infectious agents once had on society becomes marginalized. Public confidence in vaccination may erode because of real or perceived risks associated with immunization, and this in turn may lead to lower vaccination coverage and loss of herd immunity. Here, we will discuss some of the elements associated with public perceptions and fear of vaccination and place these into the context of how deadly several vaccine-preventable childhood diseases can be if vaccination coverage is insufficient.

introduction;;","In this review, we will focus on the current concerns that have surfaced regarding a possible association be- tween autism and childhood vaccination. One theory sug- gests that the MMR vaccine may precipitate autism in a subpopulation of vaccinated children (47). The second theory proposes that the mercury-containing preservative, thimerosal, is a vaccine additive that may act as an envi- ronmental trigger for the development of autism (22). ;;
Unfortunately, the fear of contracting these childhood diseases has been displaced by fears of the MMR vac- cine itself. One anecdotal study, based on 12 children with autistic spectrum disorders, has triggered wide- spread fear and concern over the safety of the MMR vac- cine because it questioned whether the vaccine was linked to increased rates of autism in immunized children (47). Since its publication in 1998 (47) and widespread media coverage (32), MMR vaccine coverage in the U.K. de- clined from 91% in 1997 (14) to 82% in 2004 (13), with vaccine coverage as low as 60% in some regions (53). ;;

Together, these two large epi- demiological studies indicate that the mortality rate after MMR vaccination is less than one death per 3.5 million vaccinations, clearly demonstrating the safety of this vac- cine over the potentially lethal consequences of con- tracting natural measles, mumps, or rubella (Fig. 2). 
Despite an exceptionally strong safety record, the use of MMR vaccination came under intense scrutiny after a clinical study published by Wakefield et al. in 1998 (47). These investigators described a chronic enterocolitis in 12 children with autism or other pervasive developmental dis- orders (PDD) (47). ;;

","Background: A causal relationship between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and occurrence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been claimed, based on an increase in ASD in the USA and the UK after introduction of the MMR vaccine. However, the possibility that this increase is coincidental has not been eliminated. The unique circumstances of a Japanese MMR vaccination program provide an opportunity for comparison of ASD incidence before and after termination of the program.
Methods: This study examined cumulative incidence of ASD up to age seven for children born from 1988 to 1996 in Kohoku Ward (population approximately 300,000), Yokohama, Japan. ASD cases included all cases of pervasive developmental disorders according to ICD‐10 guidelines.
Results: The MMR vaccination rate in the city of Yokohama declined significantly in the birth cohorts of years 1988 through 1992, and not a single vaccination was administered in 1993 or thereafter. In contrast, cumulative incidence of ASD up to age seven increased significantly in the birth cohorts of years 1988 through 1996 and most notably rose dramatically beginning with the birth cohort of 1993.
Conclusions: The significance of this finding is that MMR vaccination is most unlikely to be a main cause of ASD, that it cannot explain the rise over time in the incidence of ASD, and that withdrawal of MMR in countries where it is still being used cannot be expected to lead to a reduction in the incidence of ASD.",introduction;;,"Publication of a study claiming a causal relationship between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (Wakefield, 1999; Wakefield et al., 1998) sparked a heated debate, primarily in the USA and UK, which relates not only to the etiology of ASD, but also impacts immunization policy.

","Background. Increasing uptake rates for MMR vaccination requires an understanding of factors leading parents to decide for and against vaccination, particularly in the light of recent developments.
Objective. We investigated factors relevant to immunising and non-immunising parents and the extent to which these factors predicted their decisions.
Methods. The study was conducted in Edinburgh, UK. A two-stage mixed method design was used. Delphi technique elicited parents' views of factors relevant to MMR immunisation. Twenty-six factors identified as relevant were incorporated into a final questionnaire. Using cluster sampling, the final questionnaire was distributed to parents recruited through a group of local nurseries. 110 parents participated: eighty (72.7%) had had their child MMR vaccinated, thirty (27.3%) had refused the vaccine. The factors in the final questionnaire were analysed against vaccination status using a direct binary logistic regression model.
Results. Four factors significantly predicted vaccination status, (prediction toward ‘yes vaccination’). These were the influence of current research (OR = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.07–0.51), the helpfulness of leaflets and information packs (OR = 3.27, 95% CI = 1.38–7.75), the importance of eradication of rubella (OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.01–5.78), and the importance attached to the risk of adverse reactions (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.48–0.87).
Conclusions. Differences between immunising and non-immunising parents lie in the importance attached to four relevant factors. Excluding risk of adverse reactions, these factors have not been previously identified as salient and require to be explored further. Health advice to parents should highlight the identified importance attached to eradicating rubella and explicitly reflect research findings.

As a rule, affected patients have additional neurological symptoms. The examinations necessary for the diagnosis of these congenital metabolic diseases and possible therapeutic measures are presented.

","The identification of the candidate genes for autism through linkage and association studies has proven to be a difficult enterprise. An alternative approach is the analysis of cytogenetic abnormalities associated with autism. We present a review of all studies to date that relate patients with cytogenetic abnormalities to the autism phenotype. A literature survey of the Medline and Pubmed databases was performed, using multiple keyword searches. Additional searches through cited references and abstracts from the major genetic conferences from 2000 onwards completed the search. The quality of the phenotype (i.e. of the autism spectrum diagnosis) was rated for each included case. Available specific probe and marker information was used to define optimally the boundaries of the cytogenetic abnormalities. In case of recurrent deletions or duplications on chromosome 15 and 22, the positions of the low copy repeats that are thought to mediate these rearrangements were used to define the most likely boundaries of the implicated ‘Cytogenetic Regions Of Interest’ (CROIs). If no molecular data were available, the sequence position of the relevant chromosome bands was used to obtain the approximate molecular boundaries of the CROI. The findings of the current review indicate: (1) several regions of overlap between CROIs and known loci of significant linkage and/or association findings, and (2) additional regions of overlap among multiple CROIs at the same locus.

The objectives of this study were to assess geographical variation in trends in MMR coverage and to identify the factors affecting MMR uptake at population level. Methods: We conducted an ecological study of immunization coverage by second birthday, based on routinely collected data from 1993–2004 for England. Trends in MMR uptake were assessed in 95 District Health Authorities in England over the study period. We investigated the relationship between MMR immunization uptake and deprivation, ethnicity, education, population density, rurality, and socioeconomic class. Results: Since 2000, MMR coverage has declined significantly in virtually all areas of England. Population density and deprivation were both strongly correlated with low MMR uptake. The decline in coverage since 1993–94 was significantly related to the proportion of educated population and was greater in densely populated areas. Conclusion: Decline in MMR coverage now affects most areas of England. The lowest rates of MMR coverage remain in urban areas, particularly in inner cities, which also tend to show high levels of deprivation. Public health resources should continue to target inner city areas, as well as focus on the concerns of the better educated about vaccine safety.

The first model I will call the “public perception” view (PP view) and the second the “public good” view (PG view). The PP view suggests that the public’s perception of any risks is so important that public health policies should be formulated in direct response to knowledge about them. I will consider two possible ethical arguments that might be offered in support of such a view: the first argument is an “autonomy” argument and the second a “consequences” argument. I suggest there are serious problems with both arguments. I then outline an alternative model of public health policy formation that I call the “public good” or PG model. This model focuses on drawing distinctions between the clinical and the public health context, and argues that most of public health policy is primarily concerned with the creation and maintenance of various public goods. This latter fact means that the PP model is inappropriate for public health policy formation.

","Background
Public debate over the safety of the trivalent measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and the resultant drop in vaccination rates in several countries, persists despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness.
Objectives
We carried out a systematic review to assess the evidence of effectiveness and unintended effects associated with MMR.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2004, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2004), EMBASE (1974 to December 2004), Biological Abstracts (from 1985 to December 2004), and Science Citation Index (from 1980 to December 2004). Results from reviews, handsearching and from the consultation of manufacturers and authors were also used.
Selection criteria
Eligible studies were comparative prospective or retrospective trials testing the effects of MMR compared to placebo, do‐nothing or a combination of measles, mumps and rubella antigens on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age. These studies were carried out or published by 2004.
Data collection and analysis
We identified 139 articles possibly satisfying our inclusion criteria and included 31 in the review.
Main results
MMR was associated with a lower incidence of upper respiratory tract infections, a higher incidence of irritability, and similar incidence of other adverse effects compared to placebo. The vaccine was likely to be associated with benign thrombocytopenic purpura, parotitis, joint and limb complaints, febrile convulsions within two weeks of vaccination and aseptic meningitis (mumps) (Urabe strain‐containing MMR). Exposure to MMR was unlikely to be associated with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, autism or aseptic meningitis (mumps) (Jeryl‐Lynn strain‐containing MMR). We could not identify studies assessing the effectiveness of MMR that fulfilled our inclusion criteria even though the impact of mass immunisation on the elimination of the diseases has been largely demonstrated.
Authors' conclusions
The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre‐ and post‐marketing, are largely inadequate.

","This paper details an analysis of BBC reporting of the proposed links between MMR and autism. The study aimed to identify main issues arising from the media reports into the link between MMR and the development of autism, and how these contribute to common understandings about people with autism. The study employed a form of discourse analysis to discuss how the media debates represent people with autism and perceived risks from the MMR vaccination. Sources were collected from the BBC website, and comprised of both Internet pages and reports from radio programmes broadcast by the BBC. The analysis focuses on reports around the time of the British Prime Minister's (and his family's) decision to not disclose whether their youngest son was given the disputed triple vaccine. A key issue arising from the analysis is the ways in which science is used to argue for both the safeness of the vaccine and also the dangerousness of it. Within the media debate of the safeness/dangerousness of the vaccine priority is accorded to the experiences of families who feel directly affected by the dangerousness of the vaccine. Thus whilst scientific explanation retains its powerful position in validating and legitimating the ‘truth’ in this instance experiential knowledge takes priority. The reports draw on parental fear of ‘damage’ to their children, where ‘damage’ is constituted as the onset of autism following vaccination. Implicit within the debate is the notion that an autistic child/adult is less acceptable than a (supposedly) ‘normal’ child. The issues emerging from the analysis are in sharp contrast to our previous research with adults with autism. While the development of an autistic identity is often seen as a problem for parents and ‘experts’ researching autism, such identities can be highly valued by those so labelled.


","introduction;;
introduction;;","There has been debate about whether the frequency of diagnoses of autism has risen since the 1980s and the introduction of the MMR (see Frith 2003). Some commentators have proposed a link between these two issues and conclude that there is a causal link between MMR and the development of autism (Wakefield et al. 1998). The assumption is that the MMR gives rise to a nonspecific gut condition which allows for the absorption of nonpermeable peptides into the body which is hypothesized to lead to the development of autism (see Nicoll et al. 1998 for a critique of this hypothesis).;;
This time period provides a ‘hot spot’ of activity, debate and concern about the MMR vaccination due to the intense media reporting on MMR and the number of research projects investigating the link between MMR and autism at this time. These included a research project (Wakefield et al. 1998) which gave evidence for the link between MMR and the development of autism and Entercolitis syndrome (also termed as the autistic Entercolitis syndrome). In addition there was also high levels of media interest in the actions of the British Prime Minister who was endorsing as the only safe option for children.;;

Few studies have examined the early development of the latter group. This study developed a retrospective measure, the Early Development Questionnaire (EDQ), to collect specific, parent-reported information about development in the first 18 months. Based on their EDQ scores, 60 children with autism between the ages of 3 and 9 were divided into three groups: an early onset group (n= 29), a definite regression group (n= 23), and a heterogeneous mixed group (n= 8). Significant differences in early social development were found between the early onset and regression groups. However, over 50 percent of the children who experienced a regression demonstrated some early social deficits during the first year of life, long before regression and the apparent onset of autism.

One hypothesis is that regression is due to complications of infection (DeLong et al., 1981; Gupta et al., 1984), epilepsy or subclinical epileptiform discharges (Stefanatos et al., 2002), vaccination (Wakefield et al., 1998), or environmentally mediated exposures (e.g. mercury: Bernard et al., 2001). A competing theory is that regression, like early onset autism (Bolton et al., 1994), is largely geneti- cally influenced, but that the genes have a later onset of action. ;;
This repli- cates earlier research findings that children with autism do not differ significantly from children with developmental delays in terms of their attachment security (Dissanayake and Crossley, 1997; Rogers et al., 1991). 
The measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccine has received much recent attention after being hypothesized as a potential causal agent in autism (Wakefield et al., 1998). Although this study did not explicitly investigate causal mechanisms underlying regression, parent perceptions of possible precipitating events were collected. ;;

","According to the Autism Society of America, autism is now considered to be an epidemic. The increase in the rate of autism revealed by epidemiological studies and government reports implicates the importance of external or environmental factors that may be changing. This article discusses the evidence for the case that some children with autism may become autistic from neuronal cell death or brain damage sometime after birth as result of insult; and addresses the hypotheses that toxicity and oxidative stress may be a cause of neuronal insult in autism. The article first describes the Purkinje cell loss found in autism, Purkinje cell physiology and vulnerability, and the evidence for postnatal cell loss. Second, the article describes the increased brain volume in autism and how it may be related to the Purkinje cell loss. Third, the evidence for toxicity and oxidative stress is covered and the possible involvement of glutathione is discussed. Finally, the article discusses what may be happening over the course of development and the multiple factors that may interplay and make these children more vulnerable to toxicity, oxidative stress, and neuronal insult.
","introduction;;
Middle section; “Evidence for a Glutathione Deficiency and Oxidative Stress in Children with Autism”;;","Many theories were postulated regarding the underlying cause of autism. For example, autism was implicated to be related to the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (Wakefield et al., 1998, 2000; Wakefield, 2003); mercury in vaccines (Bernard et al., 2002; McGinnis, 2001); immune system dysfunction (Cohly and Panja, 2005; Warren et al., 1990, 1992, 1995; Singh et al., 1993; Weizman et al., 1982); fungal infection (; Shaw, 1996), toxicity (McFadden, 1996); metabolic abnormalities (Waring and Klovrza, 2000; Waring and O'Reilly, 1990; Alberti et al., 1999); and “leaky gut syndrome”(Vantrappen and Geboes, 1993). Most recently, studies have suggested that decreased glutathione levels and increased oxidative stress may play a role in the pathology (James et al., 2004).;;
Low glutathione levels may underlie many of the systemic abnormalities associated with autism. In autism, there is evidence for: (1) oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation; (2) toxicity, such as phenolic compounds (Edelson and Cantor, 1998) and toxic metals (Lonsdale, 2002; Filipek et al., 1999; Eppright et al., 1996; Holmes et al., 2003); (3) immune dysfunction, such as impaired or altered immune response and dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines (Cohly and Panja, 2005; Warren et al., 1990, 1992, 1995); and (4) impaired gastrointestinal integrity, such as epithelial pathology and increase gut permeability (D'Eufemia et al., 1996; Wakefield et al., 1998, 2000; Furlano et al., 2001; Horvath et al. 1999).

","In this review of the research literature on autism, we argue that the application of developmental and neuropsychological perspectives has contributed importantly to the understanding of the core deficits in autism and their underlying neural bases. The three classes of theories postulated to explain the developmental and neuropsychological deficits in autism are considered in terms of the specificity, uniqueness, and universality of these impairments in autism. Because we believe that a primary reason for our lack of understanding of the developmental trajectory in autism stems from our inability to diagnose the syndrome in the first three years of life, research approaches to early identification are discussed, as are longitudinal studies aimed at identifying later-life outcomes and their predictors. In contrast to the progress made in defining the core deficits and arriving at criteria for diagnosis, less progress has been made in identifying the causes of autism and in creating and testing interventions aimed at ameliorating the impairments of autism, possibly because these activities have been less tied to the developmental and neuropsychological models that have enlightened the investigation of core deficits.

","Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to develop a staged theoretical argument regarding whether non‐governmental organisations (NGOs) can be considered responsible and accountable for the direct and indirect consequences, on a wide range of stakeholders, flowing from their advocacy activities.
Design/methodology/approach
The paper is primarily theoretical and conceptual, developing a structured, conditional and staged model illustrated with empirical examples.
Findings
The paper finds depending upon the theoretical arguments accepted at each stage of the model, the advocacy activities of an NGO may be considered to cause a widespread and often unintended negative impact upon the lives of many stakeholders who are either close to, or remote from, the NGO. Also, that depending upon the theoretical position taken regarding the scope of accountability, all entities – including NGOs – may be regarded as responsible and accountable for the impacts which their activities directly and indirectly cause to a broad range of stakeholders.
Research limitations/implications
The model is primarily theoretical, so it can benefit from empirical studies to assess its applicability in practice. It also has the scope to be applied in assessing the responsibility and accountability of a range of other entities for their advocacy – such as businesses, religious bodies, political parties, and academics.
Practical implications
The paper presents a ontribution to the growing debate on NGO accountability.
Originality/value
The paper uses the synthesis of various philosophical positions to develop a conditional, staged model which may be used to establish whether NGOs (and other organisations) can be regarded as having responsibilities and accountabilities for the direct and indirect impacts of their advocacy activities on a broad range of stakeholders.","middle section;“Stage 3: plausibility and likelihood of acceptance of linear predictive narratives ”;;

","Autism is the most common developmental disorder in the United States, with the number of diagnosed cases increasing secondary to more sensitive screening methods. Because autism has no known cause or accepted treatment approach, many parents and physicians have employed a number of dietary manipulations to alter the effects of the so-called leaky gut, which is believed by some to be the underlying cause of the regressive behaviors particular to autism. However, the link between autism and a gastrointestinal pathophysiology is not substantiated by research. The dietary approaches employed are cumbersome, not proven to be efficacious, and may further narrow the food choices of the child with autism.

According to the children’s parents, the GI symptoms developed concur- rently with the loss of acquired skills charac- teristic of regressive autism.

Fluid absorbed through the epithelial cells in the distal ileum is fil- tered through the lymph nodules where an- tibodies are formed by the lymphocytes and neutrophils. It is hypothesized that the in- flammatory process of LNH allows antigens to pass into the bloodstream and exert non–IgE- mediated allergic response and central ner- vous system (CNS) dysfunction.19,23,24 The phenomenon is called leaky gut syndrome.

Key findings Examination of the development of parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom shows that, although there is no formal separation of powers, there is a long established convention that legislation should be subject to detailed parliamentary scrutiny, should respect common law, and should be subject to judicial review. This convention has been overturned. Consequently, many recent laws conflict with long-established human rights. Some are unworkable or damaging or both. Public health professionals are being asked to implement poorly thought out laws, against a background of loss of trust. History warns of the danger that public health could be sucked into participation in repressive policies that override the rights of the individual in the apparent interests of the public good.
Conclusions There is a need for a rebalancing of power in the United Kingdom, both among the three branches of government (executive, legislature, and judiciary) and its constituent parts (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland). Constitutional reform is a long-term aim but for now much can be done to hold the executive to account and to be aware of the dangers faced by public health

","Background  The epidemiology of autism has been rather confusing, with very variable published prevalence figures and no clear incidence data. The cause of autism is unclear; vaccines have been incriminated.
Methods  Literature review and interpretation.
Results  The recorded prevalence of autism has increased considerably in recent years. This reflects greater recognition, with changes in diagnostic practice associated with more trained diagnosticians; broadening of diagnostic criteria to include a spectrum of disorder; a greater willingness by parents and educationalists to accept the label (in part because of entitlement to services); and better recording systems, among other factors. The cause(s) of autism remains unclear. There is a strong genetic component which, along with prenatally determined neuro‐anatomical/biochemical changes, makes any post‐natal ‘cause’ unlikely.
Conclusions  There has (probably) been no real increase in the incidence of autism. There is no scientific evidence that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine or the mercury preservative used in some vaccines plays any part in the aetiology or triggering of autism, even in a subgroup of children with the condition.

The etiopathogenesis appears to be multifactorial and to involve altered gastrointestinal motor function, enhanced perception of visceral stimuli and psychosocial factors. More recently a role for mucosal immune activation has been suggested. Routine histologic examination reveals no mucosal abnormality in the majority of cases but quantitative histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses reveal subtle morphologic changes involving lymphocytes, mast cells, enterochromaffin cells and enteric nerves. The recent appreciation of these changes has led to new hypotheses linking central and enteric nervous systems to immune processes. This review highlights the spectrum of morphologic changes that occur in irritable bowel syndrome, examines their relationship to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome and considers their relevance to daily pathology practice.

","Many researchers have observed the paradox of the decline in trust of experts alongside the increasing use of expertise in Western society. This research argues for the division of expertise into a defined category, “expert-source”, separating experts from other sources who do not possess expertise. Using a normative concept of expertise to provide categories can offer a more coherent and consistent method of assessing a source's expertise and how to present their statements. This research presents findings based on a media analysis of television, radio and newspapers, interviews with journalists and sources and the results of national surveys and focus groups with parents and uses a recent medical controversy in the UK as a backdrop to explore expertise. In 1998 a scientist claimed there might be a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and autism. His claims received significant media attention and vaccination rates fell across the UK. This case study examines how journalists constructed expertise, how key sources presented themselves as expert-sources and the effect of balancing expert-sources with sources. This research encourages journalists and academics to question how expertise affects media coverage.

","Progress has been slow in identifying pre- and post-natal environmental exposures that might trigger the features that characterize autism. During the past thirty years, research in the field of autism has been conducted in a setting in which diagnostic criteria for this condition have changed and broadened, and differences of opinion regarding diagnostic issues and diagnostic terminology continue. The documented prevalence of all forms of autism has increased steadily during this time, suggesting one or more environmental contributors. Not established, however, is whether an increasing incidence of autism is responsible for increasing prevalence. The increase in documented prevalence could result from expanding and changing case definitions and increased reporting due to increased awareness on the part of professionals who work with children and by the public. This review provides a background for the evolving story of autism and describes the research on the relation between autism and the environment, with a particular focus on some of the more recently proposed environmental triggers. Critical analysis of this body of scientific research in a historical framework helps to explain the often controversial nature of the proposed relations between autism and environmental factors, as well as to rationalize some of the pitfalls in research design and in the often questionable interpretation of data so obtained.

Methods and results: We have reviewed all published works where mucosal biopsy specimens from autistic children have been examined histopathologically. Abstracts were excluded. Our review of the published works, nearly all from a single centre, identifies major inconsistencies between studies, lack of appropriate controls and misinterpretation of normal findings as pathology. Ileal lymphoid hyperplasia may be more prevalent in children with regressive autism but is also seen in children with food allergies and severe constipation, the latter being an extremely common finding in autistic children.
Conclusion: The histopathological diagnosis of autistic enterocolitis should be treated with caution until a proper study with appropriate methodology and controls is undertaken.

Constipation as the main gut problem in autistic children is acknowledged (> 50%), but the controls contain only a few constipated children (4/30) and it is not made clear if the constipated controls belong to the group with histopathological abnormalities or to the group in which there was no reported pathology. ;;

Since this paper adds no new information and indeed represents the third report in the literature of the original 12 index cases,1 in the interests of brevity we will not discuss it further.;;
We can only speculate why severe constipation was not acknowledged as a significant gut symptom in the original paper1 and was revealed only in correspondence.8 Having accepted, however, that this was a major problem in these children, subsequent studies from this group should have explicitly included developmentally normal children with severe constipation as the appropriate control group.;;","discusses;;

","A series of studies in children with pervasive developmental disorder and gastrointestinal symptoms has reported the presence of a subtle mucosal inflammation, immunohistochemical abnormalities of structure and cellular infiltrate, pro‐inflammatory lymphocyte cytokine profiles, and functional intestinal abnormalities. MacDonald and Domizio question the existence of the mucosal lesion. In contrast, independent replication of the original findings has come from Europe, and North and South America; the data are presented. The willingness of the authors to attribute any mucosal changes to chronic constipation relies heavily on what appears to be a misinterpretation of data that is confounded by the association between cow's milk intolerance and constipation in children. A re‐challenge effect on intestinal symptoms and a biological gradient of mucosal inflammation is evident for an alternative environmental exposure in some children.

","Objective To explore parents’ understandings of the diseases included in the current UK Childhood Immunization Programme (CIP), and the role of first‐ and second‐hand experiences of these diseases in assessments of their severity.
Methods A qualitative study in which 66 parents (58 mothers and 8 fathers) of children aged 6 years and below, and six mothers of immuno‐compromised children, took part in 18 focus group discussions between November 2002 and March 2003.
Results There were many gaps in parents’ knowledge about some vaccine‐preventable diseases, most notably diphtheria, tetanus and haemophilus influenzae type b, three of the diseases covered by the pentavalent vaccine (introduced into the UK CIP in 2004). These gaps led some parents to question the need for vaccination. First‐hand experiences of the diseases reinforced the need for vaccination in some cases (e.g. Men C), but undermined it in others (e.g. pertussis, measles, rubella, mumps). Poliomyelitis and diphtheria were no longer seen as a threat to children’s health in Britain. Some parents saw mumps as only a threat to boys’ health and rubella as only having relevance to girls’.
Conclusions As fewer parents have direct experiences of vaccine‐preventable diseases, there is an increasing need to provide parents with accessible information about these diseases. It is also important to recognize that direct or indirect experiences of any of the diseases may either heighten or diminish parents’ assessments of the severity of these diseases.

","Background
Despite the Government acting quickly to reassure parents about MMR safety following the publication of the 1998 paper by Wakefield and colleagues, MMR uptake declined. One of the reasons suggested for this decline is a loss of public trust in politicians and health professionals. The purpose of this analysis was to examine parents' views on the role the media, politicians and health professionals have played in providing credible evidence about MMR safety.
Methods
A qualitative focus group study conducted with parents living in Central Scotland. Eighteen focus groups were conducted with 72 parents (64 mothers and 8 fathers) between November 2002 and March 2003. Purposive sampling was used to ensure maximum variation among parents.
Results
In the period after the MMR controversy, parents found it difficult to know who to trust to offer balanced and accurate information. The general consensus was that politicians were untrustworthy in matters of health. The motives of primary health care providers were suspected by some parents, who saw them as having a range of vested interests (including financial incentives). Among the sources of evidence seen by some parents as more credible were other parents, and Andrew Wakefield who was viewed as an important whistle-blower and champion of ordinary parents.
Conclusion
The provision of accurate information is only one aspect of helping parents make immunisation decisions. Establishing and maintaining trust in the information provided is also important. The MMR controversy may provide useful lessons for health professionals about trust and credibility that may be generalisable to future health controversies.

The proportion of VAERS cases of autism with regression was greater than that reported in population-based studies, based on the subset of VAERS cases with medical record confirmation.

The government resisted calls for policy change despite a decline in MMR uptake. Why did the government continue to support MMR?

","Autism is well known as a complex developmental disorder with a seemingly confusing and uncertain pathogenesis. The definitive mechanisms that promote autism are poorly understood and mostly unknown, yet available theories do appear to focus on the disruption of normal cerebral development and its subsequent implications on the functional brain unit. This mini-review aims solely to discuss and evaluate the most prominent current theories regarding the pathogenesis of autism. The main conclusion is that although there is not a clear pathway of mechanisms directed towards a simple pathogenesis and an established link to autism on the symptomatic level; there are however several important theories (neural connectivity, neural migration, excitatory-inhibitory neural activity, dendritic morphology, neuroimmune; calcium signalling and mirror neurone) which appear to offer an explanation to how autism develops. It seems probable that autism's neurodevelopmental defect is ‘multi-domain’ in origin (rather than a single anomaly) and is hence distributed across numerous levels of study (genetic, immunopathogenic, etc.). A more definitive understanding of the pathogenesis could facilitate the development of better treatments for this complex psychiatric disorder.

","This study examined the effects of message framing on intentions to obtain the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine for one's child and investigated whether Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and perceived outcome efficacy variables mediate and/or moderate message framing effects. One hundred and forty women read either a loss-framed or gain-framed message and then completed measures assessing their intentions to obtain the MMR vaccine for their child, and TPB and outcome efficacy variables. Exposure to the loss frame increased intentions to obtain the MMR vaccine and influenced perceptions of outcome efficacy. This suggests that outcome efficacy, but not other TPB variables may mediate framing effects within the context of MMR vaccination. Message frame, in addition to TPB variables, significantly predicted unique variance in behavioural intentions. These findings are discussed within the context of Prospect Theory, perceived risk and prevention/detection behaviours.

","The debate on pediatric vaccination policy has been characterized by the presence of two distinct coalitions: those in favor of current vaccination policies and those expressing concern about these policies. The target of these coalitions is the vaccination decision of parents. To determine their influence, we conducted four focus groups in Toronto, Canada examining parental decision-making concerning pediatric vaccination. Our focus groups consisted of both fathers and mothers and parents who fully vaccinated and those who did not. Using the Advocacy Coalition Framework as an analytic guide, we identified several themes that provided insights into how effective the two coalitions have been in conveying their viewpoints. In general, we identified a variety of levels of belief systems existing amongst parents concerned about vaccination, some more amenable to change than others. We found that the choice to not vaccinate was largely a result of concerns about safety and, to a lesser extent, about lack of effectiveness. These parental views reflected the ability of the coalition concerned about vaccination to challenge parents' trust in traditional public health sources of information. In contrast, the parental decision to vaccinate was due to recognizing the importance of preventing disease and also a consequence of not questioning recommendations from public health and physicians and feeling pressured to because of school policies. Importantly, parents who fully vaccinate appear to have weaker belief systems that are potentially susceptible to change. While current policies appear to be effective in encouraging vaccination, if trust in public health falters, many who currently support vaccination may reevaluate their position. More research needs to be conducted to identify approaches to communicate the risks and benefits of vaccination to parents.

","Objective
To assess reasons for low uptake of immunization amongst orthodox Jewish families.

Design
Qualitative interviews with 25 orthodox Jewish mothers and 10 local health care workers.

Setting
The orthodox Jewish community in North East London.

Main outcome measures
Identification of views on immunization in the orthodox Jewish community.

Results
In a community assumed to be relatively insulated from direct media influence, word of mouth is nevertheless a potent source of rumours about vaccination dangers. The origins of these may lie in media scares that contribute to anxieties about MMR. At the same time, close community cohesion leads to a sense of relative safety in relation to tuberculosis, with consequent low rates of BCG uptake. Thus low uptake of different immunizations arises from enhanced feelings of both safety and danger. Low uptake was not found to be due to the practical difficulties associated with large families, or to perceived insensitive cultural practices of health care providers.

Conclusions
The views and practices of members of this community are not homogeneous and may change over time. It is important that assumptions concerning the role of religious beliefs do not act as an obstacle for providing clear messages concerning immunization, and community norms may be challenged by explicitly using its social networks to communicate more positive messages about immunization. The study provides a useful example of how social networks may reinforce or challenge misinformation about health and risk and the complex nature of decision making about children's health.

","Objective: This study investigated the immunisation knowledge, attitudes and practices among health professionals in two regional Area Health Services of NSW with low and high immunisation rates. It also compared these factors between the areas and between the health professional groups.
Methods: A self‐administered questionnaire was posted in 2006 to health professionals, located within the North Coast and Hunter New England Area Health Services, whose practice could include immunisation. This included general practitioners (GPs), practice nurses, community nurses, hospital nurses and midwives.
Results: Out of 926 surveys sent, 434 were returned (47%). The great majority of the health professionals (97%) believed that vaccines were safe, effective and necessary. However, in approximately one‐third of respondents, there were specific concerns about additives, immune system overload and the number of vaccines. Significantly more health professionals in the North Coast area believed that additives in vaccines may be harmful and that adding more vaccines to the schedule would make immunisation too complex. Among GPs, over half felt uncomfortable about giving more than two injections at the one visit.
Conclusions: Health professionals in this study had overall confidence in vaccines but had specific concerns about the number of vaccines given to children and vaccine content. These unfounded concerns may reduce parental confidence in immunisation.

All had been diagnosed with autism prior to enrollment in the study. ;;
In the immediate aftermath of the Wakefield et al. (1998) article, the media were faced with an important challenge: to report on an issue with crucial health policy implications, even though the scientific debate sur- rounding an autism-vaccine link was (at that point in time) ongoing. In doing so, the media was in effect “creating science” in lieu of a scientific consensus emerging (Lewenstein, 1995). ;;
Studies or claims were coded as “pro-link” if they indicated that a link was possible, plausible, or probable. This variable included, for example, mention of the Wakefield et al. (1998) article in the Lancet. Wakefield himself was often very vocal in his support for a potential autism-vaccine association; British newspaper accounts declared that he “stood by” his research findings (Day, 2004). ;;
In another sense, the cause was also external to the AVC. Gregory and Miller (1998), for example, argued that media scholars should consider the larger social context in which news stories emerge. At the time of the Wakefield et al. article in 1998, Mad Cow Disease (also known as BSE) was the subject of considerable policy debate, as the British government struggled to understand the full scope of the threat, and the British public grew distrustful of government reassurances that beef was safe to consume. Indeed, as Hargreaves et al. (2003, p. 40) noted, the AVC “is often com- pared to the [BSE] crisis, [with] both stories involving potential risks to the public initially denied by both government and mainstream science.” ;;
Scholars will need to consider a number of factors in attempting to iso- late any effects (however large or small) of frames on public perceptions of or attitude towards the AVC. First, given the long duration of the AVC (over 10 years if one uses the Wakefield et al. 1998 article as a reference point), studying public attitudes over time may prove far more rewarding that an analysis done only once at a particular point in time. Second, researchers will need to decide how best to define the impacts of frames.;;","describes;;

","Background
The presence of measles virus (MV) RNA in bowel tissue from children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances was reported in 1998. Subsequent investigations found no associations between MV exposure and ASD but did not test for the presence of MV RNA in bowel or focus on children with ASD and GI disturbances. Failure to replicate the original study design may contribute to continued public concern with respect to the safety of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.
Methodology/Principal Findings
The objective of this case-control study was to determine whether children with GI disturbances and autism are more likely than children with GI disturbances alone to have MV RNA and/or inflammation in bowel tissues and if autism and/or GI episode onset relate temporally to receipt of MMR. The sample was an age-matched group of US children undergoing clinically-indicated ileocolonoscopy. Ileal and cecal tissues from 25 children with autism and GI disturbances and 13 children with GI disturbances alone (controls) were evaluated by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for presence of MV RNA in three laboratories blinded to diagnosis, including one wherein the original findings suggesting a link between MV and ASD were reported. The temporal order of onset of GI episodes and autism relative to timing of MMR administration was examined. We found no differences between case and control groups in the presence of MV RNA in ileum and cecum. Results were consistent across the three laboratory sites. GI symptom and autism onset were unrelated to MMR timing. Eighty-eight percent of ASD cases had behavioral regression.
Conclusions/Significance
This study provides strong evidence against association of autism with persistent MV RNA in the GI tract or MMR exposure. Autism with GI disturbances is associated with elevated rates of regression in language or other skills and may represent an endophenotype distinct from other ASD.","introduction;;

Final section;“Conclusions”; Conclusion;;","The MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine scare has been one of the major health issues in the United Kingdom over the last decade. The publication of research which cast doubt on the safety of the MMR vaccine in 1998 [1] led to widespread media reporting and falling MMR vaccine rates alongside outbreaks of measles which were attributed to those falling vaccine rates. The media coverage received by the MMR vaccine peaked in early 2002. ;;
This is interesting, in light of the mostly negative coverage that the MMR vaccine received in the articles analysed. 
In the wider context of the vaccine scare, content on the alleged link between the MMR vaccine and autism/bowel disorders which was proposed by Wakefield et al. [1] was examined. A greater number of articles mentioned the link between the MMR vaccine and autism (n = 68) and the link between the MMR vaccine and bowel disorders (n = 52) than refuted the link (autism = 28, bowel disorders = 21).;;
This also reflects the nature of the reporting of the MMR vaccine scare, in that articles which mentioned the link between the MMR vaccine and autism/bowel disorders stated that the link was ‘alleged’ but did not go into detail to refute the link. The research of Wakefield et al. [1] was mentioned in 31 articles, but 17 of these mentioned the limitations of the research. 
Articles included content that recommended single vaccinations against measles, mumps and rubella (n = 48) and reported on the increased demand for single vaccinations (n = 52). ;;
Table 3 provides details of the results of the χ2 tests to determine whether there was an association between whether individuals were mentioned or not and whether specific issues were included in the article contents or not.

","The prevalence of classic autism and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) appears to be on the rise, and to date, there remains no clear etiology or cure. Out of desperation, many families are turning to new therapies and interventions discovered through various media sources and anecdotal reports from other parents. Unfortunately, many of these newer, well‐publicized interventions have little empirical support. One of the most popular yet currently scientifically unproven interventions for ASD is the gluten‐free, casein‐free (GFCF) diet.

","The mass media provides a frame for discourse around important health issues, and it has been widely demonstrated that the development and reinforcement of stereotypes of minority groups are strongly influenced by the news and entertainment media. An extensive search of academic databases failed to locate any studies which examined the representation of autism in the news media, although there were a number of articles on the media role in the autism and MMR debate. This paper reports on an examination of the extent, and nature, of coverage of ‘autism spectrum disorders’ in the Australian print media between 1996 and 2005. Key findings include a relatively limited amount of factual information and a dual stereotype of people labeled as having autism as either dangerous and uncontrollable or unloved and poorly treated. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the nature and tone of this coverage of autism and its potential impact on individuals described as ‘autistic’, their families and carers and the community in general.

The review reveals that references to culture rarely (1) specify the precise pathways by which culture influences health or (2) assess the plausibility of these pathways.

","Social and behavioral science research is integral to the conduct of HIV vaccine trials, especially because the vaccine targets an infection laden with sensitive human issues. Although social and behavioral sciences have played a larger role in HIV vaccine clinical trials than other vaccine clinical trials to date, this role should be expanded. Fortunately, related publications, conference coverage and research proposals are on the rise; community engagement is receiving more attention during the earlier stages of product development; and collaboration between HIV vaccine scientists and social and behavioral scientists is being fostered. Greater attention to social and behavioral science issues could not only facilitate accrual, but also improve research efficiency and relevance. In this review, gaps in the literature on social and behavioral science issues in HIV vaccine clinical research, including barriers and facilitators to trial participation, enhancing feasibility of trial success, health systems, policy and monitoring social and behavioral issues, are identified and directions are suggested for filling those gaps.

Three specific hypotheses have been proposed: (1) the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine causes autism by damaging the intestinal lining, which allows the entrance of encephalopathic proteins; (2) thimerosal, an ethylmercury-containing preservative in some vaccines, is toxic to the central nervous system; and (3) the simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines overwhelms or weakens the immune system. We will discuss the genesis of each of these theories and review the relevant epidemiological evidence.

From these observations, Wakefield postulated that MMR vaccine caused intestinal inflammation that led to translocation of usually nonpermeable peptides to the bloodstream and, subsequently, to the brain, where they affected development.
Several issues undermine the interpretation by Wakefield et al. [1] of this case series. First, the self-referred cohort did not include control subjects, which precluded the authors from determining whether the occurrence of autism following receipt of MMR vaccine was causal or coincidental.;;
The results were unchanged when both exposure and outcome definitions varied, including a strict diagnosis of autism.
Additional population-based studies considered the relationship between MMR vaccine and the “new variant” form of autism proposed by Wakefield et al.

Although it is difficult to analyze such a phenomenon when it is unclear that one exists (which complicates the formulation of a case definition), conclusions may be gleaned from the data with respect to developmental regression alone (i.e., autism irrespective of coincident bowel problems).;;","describes;;

","‘Anecdotal evidence’’ has become a central point of contention in two recent controversies over science and technology (We follow Nelkin (1992, 10) in referring to our cases as controversies over science and technology.) in the United Kingdom and a contact point between individuals, expert institutions, and policy decisions. We argue that the term is central to the management of the boundary between experts and nonexperts, with consequences for ideas of public engagement and participation. This article reports on two separate pieces of qualitative social research into recent UK public risk controversies with the aim of unfolding the processes by which anecdotal evidence comes to be defined. We do not define anecdotal evidence as an epistemic category that exists prior to the public controversies themselves; rather, we aim to show how the term is constructed and contested by expert and nonexpert actors. We find that anecdotal evidence comes to be accepted (albeit in different ways) by the main actors as an epistemic category, yet that it is multidimensional, open to interpretation as subjective reports, as an indicator of expert ignorance, as a source of novel hypotheses and as a set of political claims for recognition and inclusion. We conclude that the flexibility of anecdotal evidence at the boundary between science and its publics can offer opportunities for participation and engagement, as well as exclusion and alienation.

","Background
Health visitors play a pivotal position in providing parents with up-to-date evidence-based care on child health. The recent controversy over the safety of the MMR vaccine has drawn attention to the difficulties they face when new research which raises doubts about current guidelines and practices is published. In the aftermath of the MMR controversy, this paper investigates the sources health visitors use to find out about new research evidence on immunisation and examines barriers and facilitators to using evidence in practice. It also assesses health visitors' confidence in using research evidence.
Methods
Health visitors were recruited from the 2007 UK Community Practitioners' and Health Visitors' Association conference. All delegates were eligible to complete the questionnaire if in their current professional role they advise parents about childhood immunisation or administer vaccines to children. Of 228 who were eligible, 185 completed the survey (81.1%).
Results
These health visitors used a wide range of resources to find out about new research evidence on childhood immunisation. Popular sources included information leaflets and publications, training days, nursing journals and networking with colleagues. A lack of time was cited as the main barrier to searching for new evidence. The most common reason given for not using research in practice was a perception of conflicting research evidence. Understanding the evidence was a key facilitator. Health visitors expressed less confidence about searching and explaining research on childhood immunisation than evidence on weaning and a baby's sleep position.
Conclusion
Even motivated health visitors feel they lack the time and, in some cases, the skills to locate and appraise research evidence. This research suggests that of the provision of already-appraised research would help to keep busy health professionals informed, up-to-date and confident in responding to public concerns, particularly when there is apparently conflicting evidence. Health visitors' relative lack of confidence about research on immunisation suggests there is still a job to be done in rebuilding confidence in evidence on childhood immunisation. Further research on what makes evidence more comprehensible, convincing and useable would contribute to understanding how to bridge the gulf between evidence and practice.
",Background;;,"Despite a substantial body of evidence supporting vaccine safety, recent studies have consistently reported that health visitors are poorly informed about the contraindications and adverse effects of vaccines [3–6]. The recent debate over the safety of the MMR vaccine following the publication in 1998 of a paper which was interpreted as suggesting a putative link with autism [7] highlighted a lack of knowledge and confidence in the MMR vaccine among practitioners, including health visitors. Although parents' satisfaction with health visitors with respect to immunisation visits is generally high [8], during the MMR debate some parents reported a lack of trust and confidence in information and advice offered by health professionals [9].;;",disputes;;,neutral;;,no;;,

","Background
The paradigm of translational medicine that underpins frameworks such as the Cooksey report on the funding of health research does not adequately reflect the complex reality of the public health environment. We therefore outline a translational framework for public health research.
Discussion
Our framework redefines the objective of translation from that of institutionalising effective interventions to that of improving population health by influencing both individual and collective determinants of health. It incorporates epidemiological perspectives with those of the social sciences, recognising that many types of research may contribute to the shaping of policy, practice and future research. It also identifies a pivotal role for evidence synthesis and the importance of non-linear and intersectoral interfaces with the public realm.
Summary
We propose a research agenda to advance the field and argue that resources for 'applied' or 'translational' public health research should be deployed across the framework, not reserved for 'dissemination' or 'implementation'.
",middle section;“Discussion ”;;,"Our framework identifies a pivotal role for evidence synthesis – albeit of a more inclusive nature than is necessarily typical of most current systematic reviews, which are often exclusively concerned with evidence of efficacy or effectiveness. At the same time, it acknowledges that isolated research findings or even 'factoids' (assertions repeated so frequently that they are assumed to be true) influence policy and practice, whether helpfully or unhelpfully (Table 5) [37–40]. This reflects an unresolved tension between the apparently uncontentious principle that the findings of single research studies should be disseminated to groups of key policymakers and practitioners and an alternative view that it may be inappropriate or even harmful to do so without placing those findings in the context of all other available findings on the same question [39, 41, 42] – a view reflected in the CONSORT statement on the reporting of randomised controlled trials [43].;;",ridicules;;,negative;;,no;;,

","Background: Drug liabilities become more frequent, more publicized, and more costly. They impact patients' perception, physicians' practice, clinical research, and medical communication.
Purpose: To familiarize physicians with products liabilities. Data sources and extraction: Product liabilities ongoing at the 12 largest drug manufacturers are reviewed. The 2005 company reports are source documents. Medical events triggering liabilities are further reviewed. Websites of companies and health authorities are explored, and a Google search is performed. A PubMed search since the year each liability started is done. Data synthesis: Liabilities are frequent, 4.3 per company, and predominate in the United States. Multiple safety events of varying severity and frequency led individuals to claim physical damages. Plaintiffs always allege the company failed to inform users properly about drug risk. Liabilities spread across therapeutic classes. The risk increases when the label is changed or a drug is withdrawn. Publications reporting new data are frequent triggers. Company costs ranged from US$62 million to US$21 billion.
Trends indicate an increase in liabilities and associated costs. New plaintiffs are third-party payers and company shareholders. Liabilities spread outside the United States and may include lack of efficacy claims. Insurers now consider the risk of liabilities too high to continue manufacturers' coverage. Conclusions: Product liabilities impact health care. The registration of clinical studies and the posting of their results will bring more transparency to medical research and communication. This could counterbalance current liabilities trends. The future will establish whether drug liabilities are inversely proportional to the ability to be transparent with data and promptly adjust risks and benefits.

","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a behaviourally defined syndrome where the etiology and pathophysiology is only partially understood. In a small proportion of children with the condition, a specific medical disorder is identified, but the causal significance in many instances is unclear. Currently, the medical conditions that are best established as probable causes of ASD include Fragile X syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis and abnormalities of chromosome 15 involving the 15q11-13 region. Various other single gene mutations, genetic syndromes, chromosomal abnormalities and rare de novo copy number variants have been reported as being possibly implicated in etiology, as have several ante and post natal exposures and complications. However, in most instances the evidence base for an association with ASD is very limited and largely derives from case reports or findings from small, highly selected and uncontrolled case series. Not only therefore, is there uncertainty over whether the condition is associated, but the potential basis for the association is very poorly understood. In some cases the medical condition may be a consequence of autism or simply represent an associated feature deriving from an underlying shared etiology. Nevertheless, it is clear that in a growing proportion of individuals potentially causal medical conditions are being identified and clarification of their role in etio-pathogenesis is necessary. Indeed, investigations into the causal mechanisms underlying the association between conditions such as tuberous sclerosis, Fragile X and chromosome 15 abnormalities are beginning to cast light on the molecular and neurobiological pathways involved in the pathophysiology of ASD. It is evident therefore, that much can be learnt from the study of probably causal medical disorders as they represent simpler and more tractable model systems in which to investigate causal mechanisms. Recent advances in genetics, molecular and systems biology and neuroscience now mean that there are unparalleled opportunities to test causal hypotheses and gain fundamental insights into the nature of autism and its development.

","Vaccines have contributed enormously in reducing the impact of many infectious diseases, and the expanded use of new and existing vaccines provides unprecedented potential for further reducing the global burden of infectious diseases. Yet, as with the deployment of other technologies, their use may also sometimes be associated with undesirable effects that need to be identified rapidly, understood and minimized. In this article, we review the models and systems that have been developed to monitor and respond to concerns regarding vaccine safety and we give illustrative examples of real or perceived vaccine safety issues. The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) was set up 10 years ago and charged to provide the WHO with independent advice on vaccine safety issues. The role of the GACVS is both to analyze and to interpret reports of the adverse effects of vaccines that impact on global vaccination programs and strategies, and to foster the development of improved surveillance systems to detect any adverse effects of vaccines, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. It also monitors the development of new vaccines during clinical testing and advises on the safe use of vaccines in immunization programs. As success is achieved with reducing the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, there will be increasing attention focused on potential adverse effects, on the development of effective surveillance systems to detect adverse effects, and on improved methods to manage and control any harmful consequences of vaccination.

","There is considerable controversy as to whether there is an association between bowel disorders and autism. Using a bowel symptom questionnaire we compared 51 children with autism spectrum disorder with control groups of 35 children from special school and 112 from mainstream school. There was a significant difference in the reporting of certain bowel symptoms (constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence) and food faddiness between the autism group and the mainstream school control group. There was no significant difference between the autism group and children in the special schools except for faddiness, which is an autism specific symptom and not a bowel symptom.

The publication in 1998 of research carried out by several medical practitioners working at the Royal Free Hospital in London (Wakefield et al, 1998) led many people to question the safety of the MMR vaccine and of vaccinations in general; subsequently uptake dropped substancially to around 80% by 2004 (HPA, 2008a). 
The past 6 years have shown no substantial increase in MMR uptake as it continues to have the lowest uptake of any vaccine in the childhood immunization schedule (NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care, 2008) , and this has led both the DH and the HPA to issue warning of the potential for measles and mumps epidemics among children and adolescents in the UK. ;;

As 6 of 35 consecutive mold/mycotoxin (mold)-exposed children aged 5 to 13 years had ASD, we compared them to the 29 non-ASD mold-exposed children, and to the eight ASD boys. Comparisons were adjusted for age, height, weight, and grade attained in school. The eight ASD boys averaged 6.8 abnormalities compared to 1.0 in community control boys. The six mold-exposed ASD children averaged 12.2 abnormalities. The most frequent abnormality in both groups was balance, followed by visual field quadrants, and then prolonged blink reflex latency. Neuropsychological abnormalities were more frequent in mold-exposed than in terbutaline-exposed children and included digit symbol substitution, peg placement, fingertip number writing errors, and picture completion.

It is necessary to decrease the personal price paid by those who expose misconduct and to protect the personal and professional interests of honest researchers accused of misconduct unfairly or mistakenly.

","Aim
This study explored health visitors’ perception of their role in the universal childhood immunisation programme with particular emphasis on influencing factors and communication strategies.
Background
The majority of parents’ consent to immunisation, but some find decision-making in this area difficult and have unmet information needs. In the United Kingdom, health visitors routinely provide immunisation information for parents, whereas general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses tend to administer vaccines and respond to parents/carers’ questions. Research has investigated health professionals’ views and knowledge about immunisation, but less is understood about health visitors’ role and how they communicate with parents.
Method
Following the Local Research Ethics and Research Governance permissions, all health visitors (n = 120) working in one county in the United Kingdom were invited to participate in the study. Semistructured interviews (n = 22) were undertaken using a prompt guide. The interviews were transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis using an iterative approach was used to explore the data facilitated by NVIVO™ software.
Findings
Five themes emerged from the interviews. These were health visitors’ professional role; identity and perceived barriers and communication strategies, parents’ right to choose, confidence in measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination and communicating with migrant families about immunisation. There were differences between the health visitors in their perceptions of their roles, skills and knowledge and communication strategies. Health visitors perceived that GPs and practice nurses took a paternalistic approach to the provision of immunisation information, while they used a parental decision-making model. Health visitors reported a loss of professional confidence following the MMR crisis.
Conclusion
Given the evidence that some parents find it difficult to gain the information they need about immunisation and health visitors’ acknowledgement that their usual communication models were not effective during the MMR crisis, we feel specific communication skills training is needed to enable health professionals to provide parents with appropriate decision support.

This study was designed to determine if there is a relationship between celiac disease (CD) and the presence of gastrointestinal disease (GI) disease in children with autism.

Subjects and Methods

Middle section; “SCIENTIFIC AGENCY AND PARENT-EXPERTS ”;;","In the United States in particular, the focus was on thimerosal in vaccines as the major culprit for advocacy groups and parents in suggesting a causal link between exposure to vaccines and the outcome of autism in their children, when symptoms of autism generally are identified and vaccinations administered at approximately the same time period (Baker, 2008; Doja & Roberts, 2006; Geier, King, Sykes, & Geier, 2008; Katz, 2006; Normand & Dallery, 2007; Offit & Moser, 2009; Shevell & Fombonne, 2006). In confluence with the implementation of more extensive vaccination regimens of young children beginning in the early 1990s (Bernard et al., 2001; Fombonne, 2008; Stehr-Green et al., 2003), medical evidence positing a link between vaccines and ASD (e.g., Wakefield et al., 1998), and a similar time frame for vaccine administration and onset of ASD symptoms, and increased prevalence trends of ASD diagnoses puts forth, on the surface, a dramatic case that vaccines cause autism (Baker, 2008). The rhetorical use of co-occurring statistical trends and co-occurring phenomena to suggest causality is an effective way of making a claim to a wider lay public (Best, 2004; Normand & Dallery, 2007). ;;
These social conditions set the platform for the debate about the increased prevalence of childhood ASD diagnoses by consequently framing the issue in such a way as to direct attention to the more medically oriented possible causes (Baker, 2008; Furedi, 2006), subsequently legitimizing these state- ments, rather than looking to social influences such as changing measure- ments and ideas about childhood ASD (though these are often used as counter-arguments to the vaccine-induced hypotheses). Coinciding with the widespread media attention at the time to the Wakefield et al. (1998) study, considered a key catalyst of the vaccine-critical ASD movement (Baker, 2008; Begley, 2009; Kirby, 2005), focus was placed on environmental toxins and medical interventions in childhood that can affect neurological development and functioning (Matson & Minshawi, 2006). As such, the issue was framed from a medicalized perspective, one of disorder (and not simply difference), which also impacted how the issue was rhetorically presented by eager claimsmakers and subsequently dealt with (Baker, 2008; Best, 1987, 2008b; Hilgartner & Bosk, 1988; Molloy & Vasil, 2002; Poulson, 2009). ;;
If a treatment or strategy passes muster, it is formally presented at a think tank and then at a general conference. (Edelson, 2007) 
Investigation into the epidemiological breadth of childhood ASD, such as the California-based study described earlier, was prompted largely by the reaction of parents (whose children had ASD) to the Wakefield et al. (1998) study suggesting a link between vaccines and autism (Baker, 2008; Shevell & Fombonne, 2006) and the recommendation of the United States Public Health Service and the American Academy of Pediatrics in July 1999 to remove thimerosal from infant vaccines as a precautionary measure, even though there was no compelling evidence of its harm (DeStefano, 2009). Additionally, though the Wakefield et al. (1998) study was soon after critically challenged and has involved claims of fraud and ethical violations (Begley, 2009; Offit, 2008), the influence of the popular media presenting the alarming prevalence trend statistics and scientific results suggesting the possibility of serious harm being induced to children via vaccines prompted more political, educational, legal, and social movements in a variety of ways involving parents. ;;

","Objective: The objective of this feasibility study was to evaluate the acceptability and potential effectiveness of a web-based MMR decision aid in supporting informed decision-making for the MMR vaccine.
Design: This was a prospective before-and-after evaluation.
Setting: Thirty parents of children eligible for MMR vaccination were recruited from two childcare organizations in a moderately deprived community in a city in the north of England.
Method: Parents completed postal questionnaires at recruitment, one week and three months after using the decision aid. Data on the acceptability of the decision aid, informed decision-making outcome measures and vaccine uptake were collected. Telephone interviews were conducted with five parents. Acceptability data were analysed using simple descriptive statistics. Repeated measures ANOVAs were undertaken for analysing the informed decision-making data. Content analysis of the qualitative data was undertaken.
Results: Twenty six parents (87 per cent) completed all three study questionnaires. The decision aid was found to be acceptable to parents and was considered useful in supporting their informed decision-making. There was a statistically significant increase in parents’ knowledge over time and statistically significant decrease in decisional conflict for the MMR decision. Most parents (88 per cent) reported vaccinating their child.
Conclusions: We cannot extrapolate from our data to infer that the decision aid has changed decision-making outcomes or influenced vaccination uptake. However, findings suggest that it may increase knowledge about MMR and reduce decisional conflict to a level where parents can make an informed decision.

","When reporting health risks, the news media are often criticized for omitting “mobilizing” information that allows readers to act on existing attitudes. Using American and British newspaper coverage of the autism–vaccine controversy as a case study, this article takes a “behind the scenes” look at normative pressures that may influence whether such information appears in coverage. In particular, can holding health officials accountable for their actions potentially “crowd out” mobilizing information? A content analysis suggests that mobilizing information (at least one of four examples) was present in only 16% of articles, compared to 38% that mentioned accountability messages (at least one of two examples). US newspapers were significantly more likely to mention at least one mobilization example. Finally, although only 11% discussed both, articles were more likely to discuss certain mobilizing and accountability examples together.

","The success of vaccination programs is an uncontroversial reality – in Europe as well as worldwide. On the other hand, the perceived risk of adverse events in the general public is the most important threat for implementing successful vaccination programs in Europe. For this reason, monitoring and assessing vaccine safety is a priority for public health. Vaccine safety is assessed both before and after vaccine authorization. In postmarketing settings, different activities related to vaccine safety usually involve several different stakeholders. In 2005, a new EU agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, was established with the aim to strengthen Europe’s defences against infectious diseases. Implementing stable links between different stakeholders and defining clear roles in the EU is paramount in order to provide optimal and transparent information on adverse reactions following immunization, with the final goal of increasing compliance to safe and effective vaccination programs.

",introduction;;,"Today, the perceived risk of adverse events in the general public is the most important threat for successful vaccination programs in Europe. The suggested association between autism and the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vacci- nation [2,3] led to a significant decrease in vacci- nation coverage for the MMR vaccination in the UK and, subsequently, resulted in significantly increased incidence of measles and subsequent deaths [4–6]. A series of publications refuting this association has since then been published [7,8] but the public per- ception of the risk associated with MMR vaccination has proved to be hard to extinguish.

","Objective: To review the most common neurological disorders associated with various vaccines, and offer suggestions aiming at a better understanding if a causal relationship between the neurological complications and the vaccination is feasible.
Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed using combination of the following items: vaccines, vaccination, immunization and neurological complications. Review of reports and publications from the World Health Organizations, US Centers for Disease Control and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System regarding safety and common neurological complications following vaccinations. Especial attention was given to the incidence of complications in various Latin American countries.
Results: Neurological complications following vaccination are rare, and in most cases, represent a monophasic neurological event with good clinical recovery. However, serious and fatal complications have been reported. In general, neurological adverse events may not be causally related to the vaccine, and occur at much lower rates than same events following natural disease.
Discussion: Recent climatic changes and frequent international travel have changed the epidemiological spectrum of some infectious diseases. In view of the rapidly growing number of vaccines available and the need to implement massive immunization campaigns in several regions of the world, it is imperative to understand the potential adverse reactions of vaccinations. Neurological disorders are among the most serious, and on rare occasions, life-threatening complications after vaccination.

Interpretative phenomenological analysis and discourse analysis illuminated four discourses: (1) autism as transgressing normative expectancies; (2) dependency and functional ability discourse; (3) autism and the discourse of mental status; (4) autism and explanatory discourses. Participants demonstrated clear views (although not necessarily correct) about the nature, origins and manifestations of autism.

","As a result of the vaccines discovered in the 20th Century, parents and many healthcare providers of the 21st Century have limited or no experience with the devastating effects of diseases such as polio, smallpox or measles. Fear of disease has shifted to concerns regarding vaccine safety. Scientific evidence has refuted many of the misconceptions regarding vaccine safety; however, parental refusal of vaccines is increasing. Here we review six of the most prevalent controversies surrounding vaccine safety: the proposed causal relationship between receipt of the measles–mumps–rubella vaccine and autism; thimerosal as a potential trigger for autism; religious objection based on some vaccine viruses being grown in cell lines from aborted fetal tissues; parental worries that use of the human papillomavirus vaccine may lead to youth promiscuity; fears regarding the purported association between pertussis vaccination and adverse neurological outcomes; and concerns regarding too many vaccines overloading or weakening the infant immune system. Healthcare providers are ideally positioned to correct these misconceptions, but they must recognize and acknowledge parents’ concerns, educate themselves on the latest scientific research that addresses these, and dedicate sufficient time to discuss vaccine safety with worried parents.

","Background: This article provides a review of the literature on beliefs that parents of children with autism hold, with a focus on their beliefs on the cause and course of the disorder. Research on the outcomes of their beliefs also was reviewed.
Methods: Medline, PsychInfo, Nursing@Ovid and PubMed were searched from 1995 through 2009 using the keywords autism, autistic disorder, beliefs, culture, parents, attitudes, and perceptions. Additional articles were identified through Google Scholar and from references in related articles. Thirteen articles were retrieved and reviewed.
Results: It was found in the review that parents hold a wide variety of beliefs about the cause of their child's autism, including genetic factors, events surrounding the child's birth, and environmental influences in the early childhood period. Some parents continue to attribute their child's autism to immunizations, although more recent studies suggest the frequency may be decreasing. Some parents are pessimistic about their child's future while others are hopeful that new strategies will be developed. Some trust that society will become more accepting of their child's idiosyncrasies. Parents' beliefs about the cause of their child's autism have been found to have an impact on decisions regarding future health care, family planning, and maternal mental health. The link between parental beliefs and their choices for interventions has not yet been empirically explored.
Conclusions: Research on the impact of cultural beliefs specific to autism is very limited, although studies focusing on other developmental disorders suggest that it is influential.

Few would predict the repercussions that followed, but it triggered a huge controversy over the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine in the UK and Europe. ;;

While there is no shortage of bibliometric study examining some of the media dimensions of this issue (Hilton, Hunt, Langan, Hamilton, & Petticrew, 2009; Lewis & Speers, 2003; Smith, Ellenberg, Bell, & Rubin, 2008), this study proposes a novel view by choosing an information-based unit of analysis that qualitatively identifies the invocation of published scientific research and governmental policy as “boundary objects” in published discourse, and as possible evidence of assertions of authority in a controversial arena. This present study represents the first part of this effort – a content analysis of the expert literature domain of a controversial topic in an effort to identify themes and patterns that may be applied to a larger (and more diverse) corpus of non-expert literature, and to ultimately help create a more informed theoretical framework for boundary- spanning digital collections.

Introduction;;","Questions about a link between the administration of the pediatric measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine and subsequent diagnoses of autism have diffused widely through both the professional medical literature as well as through mass-market media publications in recent years. 
A 1998 study in Lancet (Wakefield et al.) proposed the initial MMR-autism link, and as of this writing, has received over 600 citations per ISI’s Web of Science database. The publication of this study, and the controversy and criticism that followed it, coincides with the rapid growth in the scope of Internet information resources and the number of Internet users (Madden, 2006), and represents a unique opportunity to explore the intersection of expert and non-expert conversations about an issue of health, science, and public policy, mediated, in part, by a digital information environment. ;;
The well-publicized controversy over a possible relationship between the administration of a pediatric vaccine for measles mumps rubella (MMR) and increasing rates of autism has reached nearly every corner of print and digital media. From the publication of the original study in 1998 in Lancet (Wakefield et al.) to analysis and commentary in Rolling Stone (Kennedy Jr, 2005), scientific research has been cited, summarized, argued over, and incorporated into policy and sub-policy public health conversations for over a decade. 
The public conversation over the possible relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism is not only a personal health question that can be situated in the domain of personal information seeking, but also a public policy and consensus-building conversation demonstrating the variability of understanding scientific knowledge in the legal/political domains. ;;","discusses;;

","Evidence-based practice (EBP) is a well established concept in the field of speech-language pathology. However, evidence from research may not be the primary information that practitioners use to guide their treatment selection from the many potential options. There are various alternative therapy procedures that are strongly promoted, so clinicians must become skilled at identifying pseudoscience from science in order to determine if a treatment is legitimate or actually quackery. In order to advance the use of EBP, clinicians can gather practice-based evidence (PBE) by using the scientific method. By adhering to the principles of science, speech-language pathologists can incorporate science-based practice (SBP) into all aspects of their clinical work. 
",middle section; “Science and pseudoscience “;;,"Or have the results been presented directly to the public at conferences, during continuing education events, in self-published books, or on the unmonitored internet? Only data presented in peer reviewed venues can be considered valid, and even then clinicians must remain sceptical (e.g., the publication of a flawed study in the prestigious journal Lancet showing vaccines cause autism; Wakefield, Murch, Anthony, Linnell, Casson, Malik, et al., 1998). 
Grandiose outcomes are proclaimed. Recall that one therapeutic technique cannot possibly work for all different types of disorders. ;;",cites as evidence;;,negative;;,no;;,

The most famous example is the Lancet paper that suggested that the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella vaccine) caused autism: the result was a drop off in the number of children vaccinated, epidemics of measles, and more than a decade of fruitless argument [7]. Another example is the New England Journal of Medicine article that seemed to show that a new drug for arthritis, rofecoxib, was safer than the traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs because it was less likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding [8].;;",critiques;;,negative;;,no;;,
